# Summary of the approach and applications


## Background and introduction

Ending poverty while managing climate change are defining challenges of
this century. In recent years, these twin objectives have become
enmeshed normatively and enshrined institutionally. In the last three
years, 193 countries committed to achieving 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs)—from tackling poverty, hunger, and gender disparities to
improving health, energy access, and education. In addition, 195
countries committed in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to
“well below” 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Notably,
over 130 developing countries committed to national emissions abatement
(through Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs), for the first time.
As a result, these countries need policy instruments to help them
achieve their SDGs and NDCs.

Environmental tax reform (ETR) has been proposed as one of the important
parts of our toolbox to do so. ETR can help developing countries reap
substantial benefits, far beyond those of climate action.

More than two decades of research in development and environmental
economics suggests that the welfare of ETR effects are likely to be more
positive in developing countries than is commonly understood.
Development co-benefits, such as direct improvements in human health or
reductions in congestion and accidents, can be very large in developing
countries, where air pollution kills millions and congestion reduces the
benefits from agglomeration externalities and urbanization. ETR can also
help finance ministries raise much-needed domestic funds at lower cost
than some conventional sources of public revenues. These revenue gains
can help expanding public expenditure, building health care and social
protection systems, as well as investing to achieve universal access to
infrastructure services such as modern energy, water and sanitation,
mobility and access to information and communication. Because ETR can be
simple to design and implement, low administrative capacity and
political support need not hinder reform efforts.

In short, ETR can be the fiscal foundation upon which developing
countries achieve both the SDGs and their NDCs. With the COVID-19
crisis, it is widely accepted that economic stimulus and restoring sound
public finances are both needed, and that the recovery process can be
designed to contribute to sustainable development. In particular,
countries with financing constraints may want to consider energy subsidy
reforms or even explicit carbon pricing to finance urgent needs in
health, social sectors or growth-enhancing tax shifts. In the second
phase of the recovery, when fiscal consolidation will become pressing,
further discussion on the potential of energy taxes is essential. In
this context, finance ministries can use CPAT to evaluate such reforms.
Another key function of the tool is to help mainstream carbon pricing
into WB/IMF country work. CPAT is thus aimed at economists in the World
Bank and the IMF as well as finance ministries (via the *Coalition of
Finance Ministers for Climate Action*) and planning & line ministries.

The Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT) is a spreadsheet-based tool to
support these efforts. It allows for rapid estimation of effects of
carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reforms along several economic
and non-economic dimensions. These include key macroeconomic variables,
energy consumption, local and global pollutants, ‘development
co-benefits’, distribution/equity and poverty. Its objectives are to:

  - Help decision-makers and analysts do quick diagnostics on the
    potential benefits from explicit carbon pricing and fossil fuel
    subsidy reforms to inform SCDs and other country strategies;

  - Provide first estimates of benefits across different dimensions
    (from tax revenues to health) to start an engagement with country
    counterpart and identify areas where more in-depth analyses are
    needed or promising.

For instance, CPAT is used for the EFI EU Regular Economic Report, which
informs the EU’s consideration of environmental fiscal reforms; Mexico’s
Public Finance Review, which examines its carbon tax; reviews of
health-related tax reform option for Brazil and China (with Health GP);
Ivory Coast’s PMR program; CGE and macrostructural models for Pakistan,
Italy, Vietnam (within the MTI macro-modelling team); and for TA to
Northern Macedonia's on environmental tax reform review (ETR). CPAT can
contribute to various reports products within the WB (SCDs, CPFs, DPOs,
CEMs, State & Trends). CPAT has e.g. formed the analytical basis for a
Bank-Fund
[report](https://www.financeministersforclimate.org/sites/cape/files/inline-files/IMF-WB%20Coalition%20Note%20-%20Implications%20of%20the%20Global%20Economic%20Crisis%20for%20Carbon%20Pricing.pdf)
to the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action on carbon
pricing.

CPAT is being developed jointly by the World Bank and IMF. It evolved
from an earlier IMF tool, described in Appendix III of a 2019 Board
Paper “[Fiscal Policies for Paris Climate
Strategies](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2019/05/01/Fiscal-Policies-for-Paris-Climate-Strategies-from-Principle-to-Practice-46826)”
and further applied in the IMF’s [October 2019 Fiscal
Monitor](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/2019/09/12/fiscal-monitor-october-2019)
on “How to Mitigate Climate Change”. Background research for the various
channels modeled has been completed by the CPAT team, notably through
the studies “[Benefits beyond
Climate](https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/10.1596/978-1-4648-1358-0_ch1)”
and “[Getting Energy Prices
Right](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF071/21171-9781484388570/21171-9781484388570/21171-9781484388570.xml?language=en&redirect=true)”.

## CPAT dashboard and outputs 

The CPAT tool is primarily a dashboard. It allows the user to input
choices regarding the policy under investigation (such as a carbon tax
trajectory, with different options for exemptions and recycling of the
revenues) and modeling choices (e.g., choice between different data
sources). The tool produces a series of assessment and visualization of
the impact of the policy scenarios on several dimensions including:

  - mitigation and energy efficiency (i.e., the reduction in GHG
    emissions, changes in energy consumption);

  - macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates (GDP, tax revenues);

  - air pollution and health (concentration, but also mortality and
    morbidity);

  - transport (road fatalities and congestion);

  - distributional impacts (per consumption decile, but also by
    (urban/rural) sub-sample, and industrial cost changes)

A schematic view of the tool is provided in Figure 2‑1, and a screenshot
of the dashboard is provided in Figure 2‑2. It is expected that the tool
is used to explore various policy options, either in an interactive way,
or to create country-specific document.

The tool is calibrated on 150 countries, but the user is advised to
remain cognizant of data issues, which can affect the quality of the
assessment. The Distribution module is more limited, as it depends on
the specific treatment of household surveys. This module is currently
available for 64 countries, but additional countries will be
continuously added over time.

## CPAT structure and methodology 

This section provides a summary of the methodology (or methodologies)
used by each of the modules, as well as basic comparison with
state-of-the-art models. The value of CPAT is to be consistent with
these state-of-the-art models in each dimension, and to provide *in one
place all these dimensions together to facilitate analysis and
comparisons and help teams prepare country diagnostics*. For the
interested reader, in-depth methodological notes are available for each
module ([CPAT chapters documentation
here](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/Epo8kZyrIi9GpLusNG8A-IsBfbDJJCzfzIBVinzJ18vgRQ?e=fQmqQb)).

### Mitigation module

The mitigation module is a simplified reduced-form model of fuel
consumption, deriving quantities under a baseline and a policy scenario
broadly in line with more complex models (the IEA's World Energy Model,
Enerdata POLES). The mitigation module's primary goal is to predict
energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, and GDP
effects over the time horizon of CPAT (2019-2035). More details are
available below in the methodological notes.

The module takes four types of inputs: (1) energy balances and price
inputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline international energy prices and
macro indicators); (3) parameter inputs (elasticities, fiscal
multipliers); (4) user-specified policy inputs (for example, the level
and coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions phase-out and other inputs).

The module's outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector,
greenhouse gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG such as leaked
methane), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power
generation, and power sector investment.

The mitigation module forms the core of CPAT: when the user chooses a
policy in the dashboard, the mitigation module works out the direct
impact of the policy, displays it in the dashboard, and passes the
outputs on to other modules (see Figure 2‑1).

The general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the
response to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form
model based on income and price elasticities. The changes in energy
consumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including
the influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP
adjusts to changes in fiscal policy through multiplier effects. It can
be considered the main driver of the baseline, while energy prices are
the primary driver of any policy, such as a carbon tax. Exogenous
changes to efficiency and the price of renewable energy are also drivers
of fuel use and consumption.

For data and parameter sources, see the mitigation chapter. For example,
elasticities with regard to prices and income are derived from Burke and
Csereklyei (2016)[^2_1] using the relationship from Gertler and others
(2016).[^2_2]

The mitigation module includes two power sector models, an
'elasticity-based' model and a hybrid techno-economic dynamic model
(‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock.
The two models use the same power demand elasticities and separately
consider power generation's costs by type. The user can either select
‘average’ – meaning an average of both models – or tailor the model
using the engineer model alone

The 'elasticity-based' model uses marginal increases in fuel prices and
price elasticities to determine the shares of each generation type. It
is simple, transparently parameterized, easily explainable, and easily
deployable in an Excel spreadsheet model used in previous versions of
CPAT and IMF tools.

The techno-economic ‘engineer’ model explicitly models the capacity of
different generation types, with capacity[^2_3] expanding to meet desired
power demand. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is allocated according to
marginal price, with a sigmoidal function of relative price. Investment
is also a function of levelized cost, with a system penalty for the cost
of integrating high levels of renewable penetration. Transmission losses
are modeled as a fixed quantity of total generation.

The main advantage of the engineer model' is that it allows modeling
decisions changing the stock of assets in the power sector (investment
and retirement) and decisions changing the use of assets for power
generation (dispatch). In addition, the model allows the user to define
a Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate. The rates reflect a
‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE additions to
be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net
of retirements). The model is consistent with countries' generation
capacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different
power systems consistent with high carbon prices, while the empirical
'elasticity-based' model is valid only for more marginal changes.

Finally, as one of the main outputs, the mitigation module estimates
carbon pricing effects on GDP. CPAT adjusts the baseline GDP growth
forecasts endogenously depending on different carbon pricing and revenue
recycling scenarios. The module captures two channels: the fiscal
effects and the impact on consumption. In the first channel, a carbon
tax has both direct and indirect effects on GDP. The latter arises when
the carbon tax revenues are recycled as a reduction of other taxes
and/or increased government spending. We quantify these effects using
the CPAT fiscal multipliers estimates. In the second channel, the change
in GDP affects energy consumption and, therefore, the effective carbon
tax revenues. This channel is captured by the income elasticities of
energy demand.

CPAT uses four sources of fiscal multipliers: “Income-group” multipliers
and “global” averages are obtained from the World Bank’s Macro-Fiscal
Model (MFMod). “Estimated” multipliers are obtained econometrically from
panels of high- and low-income countries created along the dimensions of
income levels, regions, debt levels and trade openness. Country-specific
multipliers are then obtained as weighted averages over the respective
multipliers from each sample/subsample which the country is part of.
Finally, since multipliers tend to be higher during expansions and lower
during contractions, all baseline multipliers can be adjusted upwards
and downwards by adding/subtracting one empirical standard deviation.
This takes into account the uncertainty around empirical estimates and
gives the CPAT user additional flexibility in choosing the appropriate
set of multipliers. Finally, the user has the option to “manually” enter
the preferred multipliers, thereby allowing for a thorough exploration
of the uncertainty in these parameters.

A full summary for reviewers including a list of change and full
information about the validation of the mitigation module against ex
post studies and other models, is available in the mitigation chapter of
this report. See section 3.9.

### Air Pollution module

Policies aimed to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon pricing, can lead
to a reduction in ambient air pollution due to the co-emission of GHGs
and local pollutants when burning fossil fuels. Local pollutants, such
as BC, OC, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and NMVOC are responsible for
the formation of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone
(O<sub>3</sub>) pollution. These pollutants contributed to 6.67 million
deaths and 213 million DALYs in 2019 ([Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/results/gbd_summaries/2019/air-pollution-level-2-risk)).
Air quality improvements will reduce mortality and morbidity and CPAT
quantifies those effects as a co-benefits of carbon pricing.

The air pollution module is mostly based on models developed by external
institutions and researchers, but also includes modeling developed
specifically for CPAT. The main inputs are: (1) energy consumption in
time and scenario by fuel type and sector from the Mitigation module;
(2) emissions factors net of projected average use of pollution control
equipment, fuel processing and combustion method from GAINS model[^2_4];
(3) concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone for the baseline year
(2019); (4) emissions-to-concentrations relationships for ambient PM2.5
and ozone, based on source receptor matrices (TM5-FASST), regression
analysis, source apportionment studies, intake fractions and machine
learning models, (5) relative risk functions for exposure to
PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>; and (7) population projections in
time. Details are available in the [air pollution methodological
note](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/ESNJcNab4fJNv67rvBCkzUsBUh2kDVJrdehXBrWopD2T0w?e=W3MHHe).

The main results from the air pollution module are mortality and
disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributed to air pollution
(ambient and household) under the baseline and the carbon price
scenario. Other outputs include the economic valuation of averted deaths
(using a transferred value of the statistical life), health expenditure,
working days lost due to pollution and market output losses due to
morbidity and mortality.

Reduced-form approximations are used to estimate emissions,
concentration of pollutants and health effects. We use and adapt the
results of more complex models into simplified relationships. For
instance, in the case of the relationship between emissions of
pollutants and ambient concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone,
CPAT includes the option to use the results from a linear emulator of a
complex global chemical transport model. The results of the air
pollution module are in line with other more complex models (see Figures
2-5 and 2-6), although both CPAT and the models to which we compare to
are subject to uncertainty and the results may be sensitive to the
assumptions used. We address this issue in CPAT by allowing the user to
input local information, if available, and to switch among
methodological options (with the best options possibly dependent on the
country chosen).

### Distribution module

Income inequality, poverty and, more generally, social justice
considerations are increasingly becoming a centerpiece of governments’
fiscal policy decisions. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to sharp
increases in inequality and poverty, distributional concerns have become
more relevant to decision-makers. In the realm of environmental fiscal
reforms, equity and poverty considerations receive even more political
attention than in the context of ‘traditional’ fiscal reforms. Public
acceptability is strongly driven by the reforms’ perceived fairness and
impact on low-income households.

The Distribution Module of CPAT 1.0 aims to inform the spread of the
immediate fiscal incidence *across* (vertical distribution) and *within*
(horizontal distribution; see Figure 2-7) income groups, focusing on
consumption effects and compensatory schemes. Tax-induced consumer price
changes and revenue recycling in the form of direct transfers have been
at the center of the literature on fiscal redistribution, since such
salient, short-term effects are arguably the most relevant from a
political economy perspective.[^2_6] More details are available in the
[Distribution methodological
note](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA6356749-C825-4812-856A-D8F078D42407%7D&file=5.%20Distribution.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

coverage](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3A1F6C13-3DA8-4816-9490-C9EC4444A530%7D&file=Coarse%20Distribution%20Module%20Coverage.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)).

The Distribution Module allows the user to estimate the carbon tax
incidence on consumption, taking into account the direct effect from the
use of fuels, as well as the indirect effect from the consumption of
other, non-fuel/-energy goods and services. We follow the standard
approach in the literature, combining household budget survey (HBS)
information with input-output (IO) data, adjusted such that they yield
the same effective carbon price revenues as the ones produced by the
Mitigation Module. Country-fuel-sector- price increases are based on
scenario-specific estimates from CPAT’s Mitigation Module. Further, the
user is provided with two options to relax the typical IO assumptions of
full cost-push impacts and absence of behavioral adjustments.
Additionally, there is one option to rebate the price increases of a
country’s primary cooking fossil fuel to selected bottom deciles to help
prevent them from switching to biomass.

Four modes of <span class="underline">direct and indirect transfer
schemes</span> can be simulated, once the user inputs the share of
revenues allocated under each scheme type: i) new or existing targeted
transfers (for which the user can decide the targeted percentiles, among
other features); ii) transfers towards public investment in
infrastructure access; and iii) scaling up an existing social protection
scheme (following the targeting of the initial scheme), and iv)
reforming countries’ personal income tax (PIT) schemes. The revenue
amounts available for redistribution are based on scenario-specific
estimates from the Mitigation Module. New or existing targeted transfers
are universal among the targeted percentiles, while infrastructure
transfers are targeted to those households without initial access to
clean water, affordable electricity, clean sanitation, Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT), or public transport, based on HBS
microdata. Revenue recycling that increases current public spending is
proportional to the existing social protection schemes, such as social
assistance, insurance, or in-kind benefit schemes. Further to the above,
transfer scheme targeting is also available for decile-specific
population shares that are below international poverty lines (incomes of
1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day) via “poverty-conditional cash transfers”.

Both negative consumption effects as well as positive compensation
scheme effects are expressed as shares of pre-reform consumption and in
absolute, per-capita monetary terms on a decile level, separately for
the rural, urban and overall (or national) populations.[^2_7] For
vertical distribution graphs, the user can further choose between decile
mean and median consumption data inputs. Horizontal distribution between
the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of consumption data
inputs within each decile is available for consumption effects (both
absent as well as net of compensation schemes).

### Road Transport module

Carbon pricing impacts fuel prices and shapes driving behavior and can
thereby contribute to internalizing externalities from driving.
Increases in fuel prices predictably lead to reductions in vehicle-miles
traveled (VMT). This may be a result of people transitioning to other
transport modes, e.g. public/collective transport options, choice of
residence and workplace location or behavioral changes including
car-pooling, trip frequencies and driving behavior (aggressive vs.
fuel-efficient acceleration). As road traffic has many externalities
aside carbon emissions, the reduction in VMT also leads to a reduction
in transport-related externalities such as congestion, accidents and
road damage. To estimate the magnitude of these co-benefits, the road
transport module quantifies the effect of a user-defined carbon price or
road fuel tax on (1) the intensity of congestion as measured by the time
lost relative to free-flowing traffic, (2) the number of road
fatalities, and (3) the maintenance cost due to road damage.

The Road Transport module is based on elasticities that we estimate
using an international country-year level dataset. This dataset is
compiled from many sources and describes road transport, as well as
general demographics and economic variables. The dataset covers the time
from 1994 to 2019 and 180 countries, so that we can use within-country
and between-country variation for identification. We estimate
elasticities with respect to fuel prices and with respect to fuel taxes,
as well as short and long-run elasticities. Our country-specific
elasticities are based on global coefficients and country-specific
covariates.

![](./02/media/image7.png)

Figure 2‑8. Input and output of CPAT’s Road Transport module

The magnitude of the resulting elasticities are broadly in line with the
literature: for a 10% fuel price increase from a carbon tax, total
vehicle-km traveled decrease in the short run on average by 3.5%;
congestion levels decrease by 4.5%; accident fatalities decrease by
2.9%; and road damage by decreases by 2.0% in the long run.

The estimated elasticities are used within CPAT to produce policy
forecasts of total vehicle-km traveled, congestion levels, accident
fatalities and road damage cost. By choosing a country and using
different parameters for a policy in the dashboard, the user obtains a
series of graphs showing the time series with and without the policy, as
well as the policy impact given by the difference of the two time
series.
