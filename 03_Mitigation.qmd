# Mitigation overview and methodology

## Executive Summary and Reviewer Guide

### Introduction

The mitigation module lies at the heart of CPAT. It is based on a
simplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, with two alternative
power sector models, one of which is a simplified structural
technoeconomic power model.

The mitigation module's goal is to predict energy use, energy prices,
emissions, carbon tax revenues, economic costs, and GDP effects for a
baseline and a policy scenario (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy
efficiency policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.), over the
time horizon of CPAT (2019-2035).

To this end, the module is built around different inputs, including (1)
energy balances and price inputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline
international energy prices and macro indicators); (3) parameter inputs
(elasticities, fiscal multipliers, etc.); (4) user-specified policy
inputs (for example, the level and coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions
and exemption phase-outs, and other inputs).

These inputs inform the calculation steps in which: (1) sectoral energy
prices, including the effect of pricing policy, are determined; (2) fuel
use in the buildings, transport, and industry are estimated; and (3)
electricity production costs are calculated to feed the two power
models, which then determine generation, investment, etc.

The module's outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector,
greenhouse gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG such as methane),
fiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power generation, and
power sector investment. The structure of the rest of this document is

### Summary of Methodology

The mitigation module is a simplified reduced-form model of fuel
consumption, deriving quantities under a baseline and a policy scenario
broadly in line with more complex models (the IEA's World Energy Model,
Enerdata POLES – see 3.8.3 Model comparisons). The mitigation module's
goal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax
revenues, economic costs, domestic environmental co-benefits, and GDP
effects over the time horizon of CPAT (2018-2035) for a wide range of
mitigation instruments (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy efficiency
policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.). The main drivers of the
emissions projections are GDP growth (including GDP-per-capita and
population), income elasticities, and rates of technological change.
Fuel use responses to policies are driven principally by proportional
changes in fuel prices caused by projected market dynamics and
government policies (including carbon prices).

The mitigation module relies on several inputs and provides numerous
outputs. The module is at the core of CPAT, as its results feed into
other modules.

Figure 3‑2: Overview of the mitigation module’s inputs and outputs

The general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the
response to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form
model based on income and price elasticities.[^3_5] The changes in energy
consumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including
the influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP
(which is the primary driver of the baseline) adjusts to changes in
fiscal policy through multiplier effects (see the Chapter on
Multipliers). Exogenous changes to efficiency and the price of renewable
energy are also drivers of fuel use and composition.

The mitigation module comprises two power sector models and simple
models for industry, transport, and buildings. The two power models, the
'elasticity-based' model and the hybrid techno-economic dynamic model
(‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock use
identical power demand elasticities and separately consider power
generation's costs by type. For ‘off-the-shelf’ usage of CPAT, we
recommend an average of the two models. For more tailored work, we
recommend using the engineer model.

The elasticity-based model requires only minor tailoring and checking.
As a result, it makes no distinction between short-term and long-term
behavior. It also fails to distinguish between dispatchable and
non-dispatchable generation types. The engineer power model fills this
gap by separating investments, retirement, and dispatch decisions. It
includes countries' generation capacities and makes it possible to
investigate the radically different power systems compatible with high
carbon prices. However, the model still cannot account for
inflexibility, off-price policies, and local price variation (e.g.,
coal). Due to the constraints of Excel, it can only approximate the
temporal match between electricity supply and demand.

The module's outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector
(i.e., buildings, transport, and industry). They are estimated based on
a fundamental model structure described in an IMF paper.[^3_6] Energy use
responds to energy prices and real GDP. Additional outputs include
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG
emissions such as leakage methane which represents small amounts of GHG
gases), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, economic efficiency costs,
price changes, power generation, and power sector investment.

To ensure that the model is correctly fitted, specific calibrations are
undertaken for the observed years, i.e., 2019, 2020, and 2021 (and
beyond if necessary and if data are available). In particular, due to
the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19 and Ukraine
invasion, energy prices may have behaved in an “anomalous” way, leading
the model results to deviate from the observed data. This calibration
ensures a proper starting trajectory for the model.

The rest of this section is intended to help reviewers navigate the
Mitigation documentation by highlighting the tool’s key components, and
the main conclusions resulting from the validation analysis of CPAT.

### Niche & Use cases for CPAT

CPAT requires minimal training to be used effectively. Computer
literacy, basic familiarity with Excel, and some understanding of
economic and climate concepts. Flexibility is built-in for the more
advanced user, to allow for different assumptions than those in the
default assumption set and for choosing among various data inputs.
Advanced users can also input their own data.

Although CPAT is powerful even on its own, it is still advisable to use
it alongside other tools that may have a more granular representation,
of say, technological detail, sectors, feedback mechanisms, trade
linkages, behavioral responses, etc. CPAT is designed to be light on
resource and skill needs, providing a rapid first-cut analysis when one
seeks to test various carbon pricing designs.

The carbon tax is the most effective instrument for emissions reduction
in CPAT. By default, its coverage spans the whole economy, but the user
can also set this to select sectors. The ETS covers the whole economy by
default with the option also to select coverage. A key assumption is
that the ETS and carbon tax are equivalent in a frictionless market with
full auctioning. While the ETS design lets the user select prices
(rather than quantities), frictions imply that ETS is not as effective
at reducing emissions as a carbon tax. The user can choose the initial
carbon tax level, when to commence carbon pricing, the target carbon
price, the year that the target level is achieved, and the sectoral
coverage of the carbon tax.

### Critical Policy and Modelling Choices

The reviewer should be aware of a few critical modeling choices.

First, the user has the option to as well as a carbon price to phase out
fossil fuel subsidies. Those are shown on the top right of the main
policy panel.

![](./03/media/image3.png)

Figure 3‑3: Main Settings Panel

There is the option (**<span class="underline">default to on</span>**)
to **convert the carbon price into a GHG tax** across all sectors
(including LULUCF, Waste, etc.) See the red dash on the bottom left of
the panel above.

The user can default to the Variable Renewable Energy maximum scale-up
rate (See red arrow above). The default is ‘Country Specific,’ which
gives and adds additional solar generation of 2% of the total power
generated each year plus an extra 2% for wind (except for China which
has 2.5% for solar and 2.5% for wind). The implications of these maximum
scale-up rates are in the second panel below, bottom right.

Investment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the carbon
tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment, i.e., we
assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.

![](./03/media/image4.png)

Figure 3‑4: Power Setting Panel

Fourth, CPAT, by default, has two ad hoc adjustments: a Covid adjustment
for 2021 and 2022 and a coal share adjustment. The engineer power model
coal share adjustment is a country-specific value for some countries
that adds an intangible cost to coal generation (representing
regulations not captured in CPAT plus lack of flexibility relative to
natural gas). That adjustment can be turned off in the power setting
panel (around row 131). The setting is calibrated to current coal shares
and long-term IEA projections.

### Data choices in CPAT

#### Key data used

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| For more information, Appendix G, ‘Data sources,’ gives an overview of the data used in the mitigation module. |

The main data sources are IEA data, various World Bank data sources,
IIASA data for emissions, and Energy Prices and Energy projections are
primarily from the IMF (from multiple processes).

#### Key parameters and choices

</ul></td>

</tbody>
</table>

The following key parameters in CPAT rely on different data sources or
assumptions:

  - Elasticities concerning prices and income are derived from Burke and
    Csereklyei (2016)[^3_7] using the relationship from Gertler and
    others (2016).[^3_8]

<!-- end list -->

  - ![](./03/media/image5.png) The exogenous time trend or autonomous
    efficiency improvement is set based on IEA’s data and experts’
    judgment. Values are different across sectors and fuels. See the
    caveats section.

  - Renewable scale up rates are set so that the user can choose a low,
    medium, high, or very high rate, corresponding to 1, 2, 3, and 4% of
    additional generation (as a proportion of total generation) per
    year, respectively. In addition, the CPAT dashboard provides
    transparency on country-specific scale-up historical rate, should
    the user decide to use a more specified rate as the one defined
    under the settings.

<!-- end list -->

  - The engineer power model relies on forecast CapEx, subject to a
    learning rate methodology for renewable energies.

#### Key calibration exercises

</ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A calibration exercise is performed for some key variables to prevent
the model from deviating from observed data (i.e., for 2019 to 2021) and
ensure a proper starting trajectory, particularly in the context of
Covid. Against this background, the following adjustments have been
made:

  - **Overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021**:
    Due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19,
    the energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the
    model and is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall
    numeraire in 2020 and 2021.

  - Calibration in the engineer power model:
    
      - **Total electricity generation**: A COVID adjustment factor can
        be used to calibrate total electricity generation. The latter,
        estimated by the model, is compared to observed data (IEA,
        2020). It is worth mentioning that the default in CPAT does not
        account for this calibration, but this calibration can be turned
        on.
    
      - **Share of coal**: The share of coal in electricity generation
        is calibrated to observed data in 2019 and 2020 (IEA, 2019 and
        2020). The calibration uses an additional implicit price for
        coal – if necessary – to match the observed share of coal.

  - **Emissions**: In 2019, both $CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$
    energy-related emissions are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions,
    meaning they are multiplied by a factor such that base-year
    emissions are equal in the model and the inventory.

  - **Long-term storage is based on electrolysers**: Given its
    interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on the
    costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus
    assumed as long-term storage and is measured with the interface
    (i.e., electrolysers) as the numeraire.

| Elasticities estimations. As CPAT is mainly driven by elasticities with respect to prices and economic activity, an econometric analysis is carried out to compare the elasticities used in CPAT and those obtained from empirical analysis. | The empirical validation pointed out that the elasticities with respect to price and economic activity in CPAT tend to be in the same ballpark as those estimated here, with some exceptions related to road transport and the service sector.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Ex-post studies. This section presents the literature’s estimates of the effectiveness of carbon pricing with respect to emissions and compares them to the CPAT results.                                                                    | When looking into the range of CPAT’s estimates across all sectors, results are comparable with those of the literature. At the sector level, the power sector records the highest decrease in the long run, which is consistent with the literature.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hindcasting. The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT’s forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the assumptions used when trying to reproduce historical information.                               | For the countries analyzed, CPAT generally fits the trend of observed data. There are some discrepancies and periods where gaps appear. However, for certain periods/countries, discrepancies of volatile magnitudes appear between CPAT projections and observed emissions. While this may result from implementing policies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from discrepancies in price forecasting. |

The analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.                                                                                                                                       | The sensitivity of the parameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions ranges from no effect to very sensitive when focusing on the relative changes (i.e., CO2 emissions reduction relative to the default parameter).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Caveats

There are some notable caveats/limitations to CPAT, given its largely
reduced form approach and its mid-term (to 2035) horizon. Sections of
this document could also complement this section by presenting the
upgrades made to CPAT since the last review and outlining desired
upgrades, known issues, and valuable analyses not completed.

#### Policy modeling

CPAT abstracts from the possibility of:

  - **Designing complex policy packages**, including a **combination of
    instruments** (e.g., ETS, carbon tax, and offsets) and accounting
    for **mitigation actions** in the baseline scenario (beyond those
    already captured in recently observed fuel use/price data and known
    carbon pricing mechanisms). However, policy combinations can be done
    sequentially — analyze one policy and use this outcome as the new
    baseline for the next policy, etc. In the same vein, CPAT does not
    account for **international linkages across countries or emissions
    leakage**, which prevents explicit analysis of the implications of
    border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased attention.

  - **Differences in fuel price responsiveness** may vary across
    countries with the structure of the energy system and regulations on
    energy prices or emission rates**.** Nonetheless, this latter
    default can be easily adjusted in individual country analysis. In
    addition, **feedback from carbon pricing**, like the impact of
    carbon pricing reform on commodity prices or interest rates which
    could be feedback to affect emission reductions, cannot be easily
    designed in an Excel-based tool.

  - **Non-linear responses to significant policy changes**, such as
    rapid adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies
    (deployed in the power and industry sectors) or even direct air
    capture.

  - **Upward sloping fuel supply curves and changes in international
    fuel prices** that might result from simultaneous climate or energy
    price reform in large countries. CPAT is parameterized to behave
    like the mid-point of the broader modeling literature. Although many
    models account for these factors, no big difference is observed,
    given the relatively flat supply curves for coal.

  - **Applying different coverage levels across sector groups**. CPAT
    allows the user to select the sectors and fuels to be considered for
    policy implementation:
    
      - For new policies, the coverage is binary, whether they are
        included or not.
      - Whenever the user defines exemptions for fuels or sectors and
        determines a phaseout period for those exemptions, the coverage
        can be fractional during that period.
      - For existing policies, instead, the coverage is mostly
        fractional, and it is currently computed as an average of the
        fuel demand covered across sector groups or fuel types.

#### Prices

When it comes to prices, CPAT does not model:

  - **Upward sloping fuel supply curves** **and changes in international
    fuel prices** that might result from simultaneous climate or energy
    price reform in large countries—parameter values are, however,
    chosen such that the results from the model are broadly consistent
    with those from far more detailed energy models that, to varying
    degrees, account for these sorts of factors (see Section 3.8.3).

  - **Institutional setup driving prices**. In CPAT, energy demand
    responds to prices in the private sector, although the institutional
    setup could, in some markets, prevent prices from determining supply
    and demand.

#### Emissions

The following limitations and constraints exist when computing the
emissions:

  - **In the current version of CPAT, international linkages across
    countries or emissions leakage are not factored in**. This prevents
    explicit analysis (in the first public version) of the implications
    of border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased
    attention.

  - **Energy related N2O emissions are calibrated on CO2 emissions
    preventing the independence of one from the other**.

  - In the case of LULUCF CO2 emissions, **a condition to model the sink
    activity can create an irreversible state of a positive sink** (more
    absorptions than emissions). Even if the previous year’s emissions
    (the year before the base year) are negative, there is no
    possibility of returning to a negative sink.

#### Energy use (all energy sectors)

A first important caveat, common to all of our approaches, lies in the
fact that the **autonomous efficiency improvement and time trend of
consumer preferences and technology are treated in the same way**. In
other words, it is implicitly assumed that the time trend of consumer
preferences and technology is not varying. However, it can be subject to
changes over time. For instance, technology can get more or less energy
intensive as it changes.

#### Power sector

The two different power models in CPAT have different strengths and
weaknesses. For ‘off-the-shelf’ use, we recommend using the average of
the two models. We recommend the techno-economic (‘engineer’) power
model specified with detailed modeling choices and input parameters for
more tailored use.

The **elasticity-based power model** is responsive to *relative* price
changes but not absolute prices. It does not explicitly model the
capital stock, so it cannot distinguish between short-run capacity
factor differences and long run capital stock changes. Thus, changes in
generation for fixed capacity stock generation types may be too fast. It
may also model unrealistic reductions in generation from renewables if
their price were to increase relative to other options. Conversely,
changes in generation for dispatchable types may be insufficiently
responsive to price. The model could produce outcomes that are not
physically realistic.

The **techno-economic ‘engineer’ power** model has the following
caveats:

  - **Investment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the
    carbon tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment,**
    i.e., we assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.

  - **The power maximum retirement rate for coal is set to 80%**.

  - **Estimates of national capacity by generation type across time**.
    Since no such dataset exists globally, CPAT’s current approach
    relies on its own estimates. Fossil capacity collected from the EIA
    is scaled using independently estimated shares.

  - **In CPAT, the investment decision is not fully commercial** but
    assumes a quasi-least cost approach to meeting aggregate energy
    demand (and power demand).

  - **Fiscal expenditures of government investment in power are not
    accounted for**. Such a feature is not implemented, partly because
    power investment is typically funded by customers even if financed
    by the government – so including it would raise consistency issues.

  - **There could be a better assessment of flexibility** (and ease of
    implementing VRE) based on the capacity reserve.

  - **Losses associated with round-trip efficiency** (i.e., the ratio
    between the power put in and the energy retrieved from storage) are
    currently **not accounted for in the current model**. Power storage
    consumes electricity and saves it to hand it then back to the grid.
    The higher the round-trip efficiency, the less energy is lost in the
    storage process.

#### Desirable upgrades, known issues, and useful analyses not completed: General

This section contains our assessment of upgrades that are desirable but
were not able to be completed. **We do not propose to do all these
upgrades and seek the reviewer’s opinions if any of them are must-haves
before releasing CPAT to the broader community.**

#### Power Sector Models

CPAT does not aim to replace models like EPM; thus, we have limited the
upgrades.

#### Remaining Known Bugs or Issues

A model as complex as CPAT has some ongoing issues. These are stated
here and are, in most cases, minor.

| Comment                                        | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PPAs                                           | PPAs only affect dispatch and so have limited effect in the long term. Probably not an issue, but it needs an investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| State-owned power markets; Investment decision | Currently, the investment decision is driven by the carbon price, representing a shadow price for investment appraisal. This needs to be flagged more strongly for regulated power markets either in the documentation or in CPAT, or an option to explicitly add/remove a shadow price for investment appraisal. |
| Bhutan and elasticity power model              | Issue when in the elasticity model that the balances do not fully balance between energy consumption and energy supply and when exports or imports are substantial (e.g., in Bhutan).                                                                                                                             |
| Russia                                         | Russia’s results need to be confirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Small Countries                                | There are some issues with a few smaller economies. See the appendix showing the country list working. We do not intend to remediate all countries due to data limitations.                                                                                                                                       |

### Notation and Acronyms

A table summarizing the Notation used is available in each modeling
section. This section describes dimensions and acronyms.

#### Dimensions

CPAT exists across multiple dimensions. Each will be given the following
index notation in the same order as described below.

| **Variable**                   | **Index** |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Scenario[^3_10]                 | $o$     |
| Country                        | $c$     |
| UNFCCC emissions sector[^3_11]  | $u$     |
| Sector grouping[^3_12]          | $g$     |
| Sector                         | $s$     |
| Fuel and generation type[^3_13] | $f$     |
| Pollutant                      | $p$     |
| Year[^3_14]                     | $t$     |

That means that a typical variable might be defined as follows
$x_{\text{ocsf},t}$ – with $x$ being specific to scenario, country,
sector, fuel type, and time. Particular values for these general indices
are indicated with capitals, for example, o=B for baseline.

The codes corresponding to elements of the dimensions (for example, fuel
types and sectors) are also defined in tables in the appendices.

### Overview

At the time of writing, the base year for CPAT is 2019. The base year
plus the next two years (2020 and 2021) are considered the ‘historical
price years’ for CPAT. The algorithm for the historical price years and
the future price years is different; we use historical price information
in the historical price years and a forecast approach for the future
price years.

Domestic price information for historical time periods comes from a
dataset created by the IMF side of the joint WB-IMF team. We refer to
this dataset as the ‘IMF dataset’. Information about this dataset is
available from the IMF and is not part of this documentation. The user
can supplement these data with specifically-sourced data (‘manual
inputs’).

To forecast domestic prices forward, we also use projections of
*international* fuel prices (for example, crude oil prices). These
forecasts are created as an average of internationally recognized
sources. The default is an average of IMF and WB projections, although
other options are available if the user chooses. The user should however
make sure that these sources are updated.

While the method used to build the data may change from the ‘historical
price years’ to the years where fuel prices are forecasted, the identity
to obtain retail prices $p_{\text{cgft}}$ (for a given country $c$,
sectors grouping $g$ and fuel type $f$, during period $t$) remains
the same: **Retail prices equal the supply costs plus all relevant
taxes**. As for latter, the different hierarchies, coverage, exemptions,
and types of tax, require additional disaggregations. For instance,
value added taxes may be paid on top of other taxes and fees, so it will
be convenient to express the retail price identity as:

$p_{\text{cgft}} = sp_{\text{cgft}} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgft}} + \text{tx}o_{\text{cgft}}$

where $\text{sp}$ stands for the supply cost (also referred to as the
pre-tax price), $\text{vat}$ is the value added tax, and
$\text{txo}$ stands for the excise and all other taxes. Furthermore,
$\text{txo}$ acts as net additional taxes, as it corresponds to the
addition of consumer subsidies $\text{cs}$, fixed or ad valorem taxes
$\text{fao}$, any existing carbon price $\text{xcp}$, and any new
carbon price $\text{ncp}$:

$\text{tx}o_{\text{cgft}} = cs_{\text{cgft}} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cgft}} + \text{xc}p_{\text{cgft}} + \text{nc}p_{\text{ocgft}}$

Note that the existing and new carbon prices may result from policies
related either to carbon taxation or ETS permit prices, as it will be
explained in upcoming sections.

The table below summarizes the process used to build the information for
prices and subsidies for the base years and the forecasted period.
Additional information on each element can be found in the upcoming
sections.

Fuel prices are different for each combination of fuel type $f$,
country $c$ and ‘sector group’ $g$ (for prices meaning Residential,
Industrial-including-Services, Transport and Power). Within the sector
group, prices are equal – although more granular sectoral exemptions
mean that prices in the sector can differ.

### Base years: Sources of information

The IMF dataset on prices and subsidies includes data for supply costs,
producer subsidies, VAT, excise and other taxes, consumer subsidies, and
retail prices by country, sector group and fuel type. This dataset is,
hence, at the core of the information for historical prices used in
CPAT. Existing policies (carbon taxation or ETS permits) with
information both in terms of carbon price levels as well as the fuel and
sector coverage, complete the dataset for CPAT’s ‘historical price
years’. A brief description of the price components used in CPAT is
provided below:

**Historical retail price:** Included in the IMF data set. Rounding
errors aside, it equals the sum of supply costs, VAT, and excise and
other taxes.

**Supply cost:** Included in the IMF data set. It is calculated as a
weighted average of domestic extraction costs and international prices
plus transport costs, where the weights refer to the proportion of the
components that are domestically produced or imported.

**VAT:** Included in the IMF data set. Computed as VAT collected over
total sales (for a given fuel and sector), or as the result of applying
a country or sector-specific VAT rate to the sales of a fuel to a
sector.

**Consumer Subsidy:** Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total
subsidy over total sales (for a given fuel and sector).

**Producer Subsidy:** Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total
subsidy over total sales (for a given fuel).

**Existing Carbon Price:** Sourced from *State and Trends of Carbon
Pricing*.

**New Carbon Price:** User-defined. It is typically zero in the base
years.

**Fixed ad valorem and other taxes:** Balancing item, computed as a
residual:
$\text{fao} = \text{txo} - \text{cs} - \text{xcp} - \text{ncp}$.

### Forecasted years: Construction of data on prices and taxes

**Supply cost** for a fuel type $f$ in a given country $c$ and
sector grouping $g$ and during period $t$, is calculated using a
coefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019) to the global
prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective international
fuel price in year $t$:

$sp_{\text{cgft}} = \frac{sp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{gp_{f,t_{0}}}*gp_{\text{cft}}$

where $sp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}$ denotes the average supply costs for
country $c$, fuel $f$ in sector $g$ in base years $t_{0}$,
$gp_{f,t_{0}}$ is the average global fuel price in base years, and
$gp_{\text{cft}}$ is the global fuel price based on the chosen
international energy price forecast in year $t$. As for the latter,
note that information on global prices may be taken from different
markets depending on the region or country.

In practice, the supply costs dependence on global prices may not be the
same for a country that produces the fuel vs. one that imports it.
Moreover, the supply cost can be affected by any existing producer-side
subsidies, as well as by simulated policies where these would be phased
out. The treatment of these advanced cases is presented in Appendix C -
Prices And Taxes Methodology.

**VAT payment** equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the
supply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:

$\text{va}t_{\text{cgft}} = \frac{\text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgft}}$

NOTE: 1. Users are given the option to include $\text{txo}$ as part of
the VAT base; 2. The residential and transport sectors may instead be
computed by applying a nation-wide constant VAT rate to the VAT base
($\text{sp}$, here).

**Consumer-side fossil fuel subsidy:** Based on the fixed part of
consumer subsidy per unit of energy, the new value is adapted to account
for phasing-out of consumer side subsidies, and the phasing out of price
controls, that create implicit subsidies.

$cs_{\text{cgft}} = cs_{cgf0}*\phi_{\text{CS},t} + \left( \text{pc}c_{\text{cf}} - 1 \right)*\left( \text{Δg}p_{\text{ft}}*\phi_{\text{PC},t} \right)$

where $\phi_{\text{CS}}$ is the phase-out factor for consumer-side
subsidies, $\phi_{\text{PC}}$ is the phase-out factor for price
controls, $\text{pc}c_{\text{cf}}$ is the price control coefficient
and $\text{Δg}p_{\text{ft}}$ is the difference between current and
previous global prices.

**Fixed ad valorem and other taxes** are projected based on last year’s
information. There are two possible cases:

$\text{fa}o_{\text{cgft}} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\frac{\text{Σfa}o_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}} & \text{if\ fixed} \\
 & \\
\frac{\text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgf},t} & \text{if\ ad\ valorem} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

where $\frac{\text{Σfa}o_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}}$ represents
the average value of $\text{fao}$ during the base year.

**Existing Carbon Price:** Resulting for already implemented carbon
taxes or ETS permits and their prices, it is assumed that these policies
are complemented by any new measure selected by the user. Thus, the
price is assumed to be equal to the latest available observation:

$\text{xc}p_{\text{cgft}} = \text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t - 1} = \text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{CT}} \right) + \text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t - 1}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{ETS}} \right)$

with $\text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}$ and
$\text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t - 1}$ representing the existing carbon
taxes and ETS permit prices per energy unit, respectively. As part of
the advanced options, CPAT allows the user to select a fix growth rate
for each – the existing carbon tax and the existing ETS permit price.
This is captured by the parameter $\delta$ in both cases.

**New Carbon Price:** It accounts for the price resulting from the
implementation of new policies (carbon taxation or ETS permit prices).
It can be decomposed as follows:

$\text{nc}p_{\text{cgft}} = \text{nc}t_{\text{cgft}} + \text{nets}p_{\text{cgft}} = \text{NC}T_{\text{ct}}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgft}} + \text{NETS}P_{\text{ct}}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgft}}$

where $\text{nc}t_{\text{cgft}}$ and $\text{nets}p_{\text{cgft}}$
stand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per
energy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is
obtained based on the national price per ton of $CO2$
($\text{NC}T_{\text{ct}}$ or $\text{NETS}P_{\text{ct}}$), and
scaling it by the country-sector-fuel specific emission factors,
$ef_{\text{cgf}}$, and the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies
within the country in question ($\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgft}}$ and
$\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgft}}$).

Among the options available, the user can select the sector or fuel that
will be exempted from the policy implemented. This is already considered
in the sector-fuel coverage $\varphi$. Moreover, such exemptions can
be phased out according to user-defined parameters.

Note that both the existing and the new ETS permit prices per ton of
CO2, $\text{XETS}P_{c,t}$ and $\text{NETS}P_{c,t}$ respectively,
correspond to the **adjusted** values after the penalization. In other
words, to the value comparable to the level of a carbon tax. For more
information on this, refer to Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology.

**Excise and other taxes** are computed as the sum of its forecasted
components.

$\text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} = cs_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cgf},t}$

**Retail price** for fuel $f$ in sector $s$ in years $t$ is the
sum of the supply price, VAT, and excise and other taxes.

$p_{o,\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \left( cs_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cgf},t} \right)$

It should be noted that, while this relationship is true for all cases,
for the baseline scenario the new carbon price component, included in
$\text{txo}$, is null.

### Price aggregation

For reporting purposes, it is convenient to have an aggregate price for
each type of fuel within a country. This price, computed for each
scenario, is obtained as a weighted average of the sector-specific
retail prices, where the weights are given by the total use of fuel
$f$ in country $c$:

$P_{\text{cf},t} = \sum_{g}^{}{\frac{F_{\text{cgf},t}}{\Sigma_{g}F_{\text{cgf},t}}*p_{\text{cgf},t}}$

where $P_{\text{cf},t}$ is the aggregate price for fuel $f$ in
country $c$, $F_{\text{cgf},t}$ is the use of fuel $f$ in sector
$g$ within country $c$, and $\Sigma_{g}F_{\text{cgf},t}$ is the
aggregation of the fuel $f$ use across all sectors in that country.

## Fuel Consumption

### Overview

CPAT’s mitigation module is based on a fundamental model structure
described in a recent IMF paper.[^3_15] Energy use responds to energy
prices and real GDP (total real GDP, not per capita GDP). The price
elasticity includes a ‘usage’ response (e.g., how much each car is used)
and an ‘energy efficiency’ (e.g., how fuel efficient the car is)
component. The fuel equation estimate fuel consumption in the different
sector groupings of CPAT.

In what follows, we present the equation form and then specific cases in
which the equation might be slightly transformed or in which we factor
in additional technologies in accordance with the sector under
consideration, that is Transport, Buildings, Industry, Other Energy Use
and Electricity.

### Fuel Consumption Dynamics

The fuel use for fuel type $f$ and sector $s$ can be related to the
fuel use in the previous year as follows:

$\frac{F_{\text{ocsf},t}}{F_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \left( \frac{1}{1 + \alpha_{\text{sf}}} \right)^{1 + \epsilon_{U,c\text{sf}}}\Psi_{\text{ct}}\left( \frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{Y,\text{csf}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{csf}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{csf}}\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U,\text{csf}} \right)}$

where the main components of the equation are $F$, the fuel usage in
ktoe, $Y$, the total real GDP, the prices $p$ as presented in
Section 3.2, $\alpha$, the autonomous annual energy efficiency
improvement and, $\Psi$, a Covid adjustment factor to energy demand
(see Section 3.3.4.4). Note that additional policies affecting the
parameter $\alpha$ can be manually added.

![Figure 36: Dashboard: Additional policy-induced efficiency gains by
sector](./03/media/image6.png)

Figure 3‑5: Dashboard: Additional policy-induced efficiency gains by
sector

$\epsilon_{Y}$ denotes the forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel
demand for fuel $f$ in sector $g$. It thus translates a 1% increase
in total real GDP into a fuel demand increase. CPAT does not distinguish
between the elasticity for real-GDP-per-capita and the elasticity for
population.

$\epsilon_{U}$, is the elasticity of usage of energy products and
services (i.e. for a 1% increase in prices, how much will total usage be
affected in the same year).

Finally, $\epsilon_{F}$ denotes the efficiency price elasticity.

For more information on the elasticities and the autonomous annual
energy efficiency improvement, see Section 3.3.5. The latter is set to
0.5% or 1%, depending on the sector.

The terms of the energy use equation represent:

  - A **GDP effect**
    $\left( \frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{Y,\text{csf}}}$
  - A **price effect on usage**
    $\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{csf}}}$
  - A **price effect on energy efficiency**,
    $\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{csf}}\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U,\text{csf}} \right)}$

Both autonomous and price-driven efficiency components are subject to
rebound effects by raising to the power of
$\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U} \right)$, where $\epsilon_{U}$ is negative.

Note that the term effect on energy efficiency is affected by the shadow
price[^3_16] in case non-pricing policy types are implemented, that is
feebates and power feebates, energy efficiency regulations, vehicle fuel
economy, residential and industrial efficiency regulations. In the
equation, the shadow price only affects the efficiency margin and not
the price effect since, for instance, an energy efficiency regulation
does not aim to increase prices but increases the efficiency.

For simplicity, we assume that all the effects take place over the
course of one year. In reality, some effects will take time, but CPAT
abstracts from these effects. CPAT is more suited to anticipated and
progressively phased policies over the medium term.

Energy use is aggregated into five main sector groupings: Transport,
Buildings, Industry, Other Energy Use and Electricity demand.

### Specific cases

Few specific cases slightly affect the energy use equation described
above or the energy composition, that is:

  - The breakdown of biofuels and existence of jet fuel in the transport
    sectors;
  - Self-generated renewables in the building and industry sectors;
  - The substitution between biomass and LPG/kerosene/natural gas in the
    residential sector;
  - For the year 2020-21, energy use is calibrated with a Covid
    adjustment;
  - Fuel transformation; and
  - Other energy use sector.

#### Biofuels and jet fuel

In the transport sector, for road transport only, biomass is further
broken down into Bioethanol, Biodiesel and Other Biofuels. In addition,
domestic aviation jet fuel is a fuel type not seen in other sectors.

#### Self-generated renewables

When aggregating energy use at the sector level, power generated outside
of the power sector, that is self-generated renewables, is also
accounted for. The energy use equation is the same as the one presented
above, and the price used is that of solar energy.

#### Biomass substitution in the residential sector

When aggregating energy used, an option to account for **leakage into
biomass** in the residential sector is available.

![Figure 37: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT](./03/media/image7.png)

Figure 3‑6: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT

If this option is turned on, a percent change of the most used cooking
fuel (i.e., natural gas, LPG or kerosene) is transferred to biomass. In
other words, the relative price change in the most used cooking fuel
results in a percentage change in its consumption; this variation change
is substituted by biomass. The latter is composed of the substitution
elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass
($\epsilon_{\text{bio},f}$), but also accounts for the relative
efficiency between the fuels considered, that is only natural gas, LPG
and kerosene ($f = \text{nga},\text{lpg\ and\ ker}$) and biomass
($\text{Ef}f_{f}$ and $\text{Ef}f_{\text{bio}}$, respectively):

$\epsilon_{\text{bio},f}*\frac{\text{Ef}f_{\text{bio}}}{\text{Ef}f_{f}}$

The substitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and
biomass, $\epsilon_{\text{bio},f}$, is 0.25 (see Section 3.3.5 for
more information). The efficiency[^3_17] for each fuel is detailed in the
table below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><blockquote>
<p><strong>Energy type</strong></p>
</blockquote></th>
<th><blockquote>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>
</blockquote></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Natural gas</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>0.58</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p>LPG</p>

<td><blockquote>
<p>0.56</p>

<tr class="odd">

</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Biomass</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>0.20</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The proportion of the natural gas transferred to biomass is thus
dependent on the relative efficiency of representative stoves that are
used. Therefore, for a 10% price change in, for instance, natural gas,
0.9% of natural gas consumption is shifted to biomass.

#### Calibration of overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021

Due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by the Covid-19,
the energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the model
and is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall numeraire in
2020 and 2021.

This sets baseline 2020 emissions to equal estimates for most countries
and applies a GDP-linked scalar adjustment for all other countries to
match global emissions (difference in recent three-year average GDP
growth vs. 2020 growth rate times 1.4). For 2021, emissions are set for
very large emitters (US, China, India, EU) to a specific rebound
vs. 2019 emissions per the Global Carbon Project (2021), and to a
scalar that results in -4.2% vs. 2019 emissions for all other countries.
Estimates can be found at the end of the tab ‘GHG’.

![Figure 71: Summary of the CPAT v1.0 structure](./03/media/image8.png)

Figure 3‑7: Summary of the CPAT v1.0 structure

#### Fuel transformation

In CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings,
industry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation
in balances) and fuel transformation. The fuel transformation sector
(FTR) is determined as **the difference between primary and final energy
consumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector**. This
residual is treated as an additional industrial sector called fuel
transformation.

In addition, all oil products and natural gas are aggregated to avoid
dealing with negative fuel consumption. The FTR, computed as a residual,
is treated as an additional industrial sector called ‘transformation’.
For the forecasted years, its consumption follows the main mitigation
fuel equations.

#### Other energy use

The other energy use sector contains principally military fuel use. No
carbon taxes are imposed in this sector.

### Income and Price Elasticities of Demand

#### Overview

The current version of CPAT uses a derived set of elasticities based on
Burke and Csereklyei (2016)[^3_18] using the relationship from Gertler
and others (2016).[^3_19]

#### Income elasticities

Income elasticities relate to general energy demand (electricity,
transport, industry, services, residential and other).

Income elasticities of energy demand are selected based on a broad
literature review, simplified, adjusted for development levels, and
sense-checked to a large dataset of income elasticities and outputs of
other models. There are 32 ‘base’ income elasticates in CPAT covering
eight energy sources (coal; natural gas; gasoline; diesel; other oil
products like LPG and kerosene; biomass; small-scale renewables like
solar PV; and electricity) and four sectors (transport including road,
rail, aviation and shipping; residential; heavy industries; and public
and private services).

These are then sense-checked against a database of income elasticities
collected by the authors, which covers over 250 studies 2,000
observations of income elasticities across countries. Next, these are
each adjusted for income per capita of the country considered in each
projection period (‘adjusted income elasticities’) to reflect the broad
finding that income elasticities decline with development. Lastly, the
elasticities are checked once more through model intercomparison:
comparing the baseline projections from those of many other global,
regional, and country-specific models. The process is described further
below.

![Figure 54: Income elasticities: Base income elasticities of energy
demand in CPAT](./03/media/image9.png)

Figure 3‑8: Income elasticities: Base income elasticities of energy
demand in CPAT

Base income elasticities for sectors are selected based on Burke and
Csereklyei (2016), which covers 132 countries from 1960-2010.
Fuel-specific elasticities within sectors are then selected based on a
literature review such that the weighted global average income
elasticity across fuels is within one standard deviation of those found
for sectors (left panel of Figure 3-55). Broadly, energy demand grows
more quickly in services, industry, transport, and other sector than it
does in the residential or agricultural sectors.

![Figure 55: The relationship of fuel demand to GDP across countries –
by sector (left panel, mean estimated elasticities 1960-2010) and by
development levels (right panel, unadjusted and adjusted elasticities
with respect to log GDP 1985-2010)](./03/media/image10.png)

Figure 3‑9: The relationship of fuel demand to GDP across countries by
sector (left panel, mean estimated elasticities 1960-2010) and by
development levels (right panel, unadjusted and adjusted elasticities
with respect to log GDP 1985-2010) – Source: left panel from Burke and
Csereklyei (2016); right panel inferred from Gertler and others (2016),
adjusted upwards to match the global average income elasticity for
energy in left panel

It is then further assumed that income elasticities have a reverse-U
shape with respect to income levels. This relationship has been found by
numerous studies (Gertler et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2018; Liddle and
Huntington 2020; Caron and Fally 2022). This non-homothetic relationship
between incomes and energy could be reflective of the rapid rise in
ownership of key energy consuming assets like refrigerators, air
conditioners, and vehicles whose ownership tends to binary in nature
(e.g. households purchase one fridge but not additional fridges as they
become wealthier; Gertler et al. 2016). It could also reflect the
Environmental Kuznets effect (as incomes increase economies reduce their
environmental destruction by, for example, consuming fewer fossil fuels)
(Saqib and Benhmad 2021) or ‘dematerialization’ (richer countries tend
to need fewer materials for marginal production and hence become more
energy efficient).

The relationship between per capita incomes and energy demand is derived
from Gertler and others (2016) based on data cross-country analysis
1985-2010. This is then adjusted upwards such that the inferred global
average income elasticity from this shape equals that found by Burke and
Csereklyei (0.74, 2016) over the same time period (1960-2010). This
adjustment is then applied to each base income elasticity’s base for
each country over the projection period (varying with each year). The
impact for selected fuel-sector pairs is shown in left panel below for
per capita GDP and in the right panel for log GDP. Income elasticities
jump up as countries graduate from being lower-income to a peak around
lower-middle income status (at around $3,000 per capita) and then
asymptotically decline until reaching the developed country maximum (at
around $22,000 per capita).

![Figure 56: Per capita GDP adjusted income elasticities, selected
fuels/sectors by GDP (left) and log GDP (right)](./03/media/image11.png)

Figure 3‑10: Per capita GDP adjusted income elasticities, selected
fuels/sectors by GDP (left) and log GDP (right) – Source: IMF staff
using Burke and Csereklyei (2016), Gertler and others (2016), and
various other sources.

Lastly, the results of these income elasticities on baseline energy
consumption and emissions are then sense checked through a model
inter-comparison. Overall, they allow for initially rapid accelerations
in energy demand in developing countries (as households purchase
energy-consuming goods like fridges, air conditioning units and cars) as
well as broader structural change as countries increase the share of
services in GDP and energy consumption.

#### Price elasticities

Own-price elasticities of energy demand are parametrized using a similar
approach to income elasticities. A major meta-study to estimate
elasticities for fuels, which are then simplified and calibrated to
allow for sectoral coverage, sense- and then finally sense checked to a
large in-house dataset through model-intercomparison. These steps are
described in turn.

Price elasticities in CPAT separated into two broad margins (see below).
CPAT contains two types of price elasticities to distinguish between
behavioral responses: the direct reduction in demand from reduced
intensity of use from existing capital-consuming goods like vehicles
(‘intensive margin’) and changes in the composition and scale of those
goods (‘efficiency and extensive margin’). The two effects combined less
the rebound effect (described later) correspond to the total price
elasticity of demand, which is parametrized to the empirical
literature[^3_20].

Table 3‑1 Price elasticities of energy demand in CPAT – Source: IMF
staff using various sources. Tables show price elasticities used for
developed countries. For developing countries, extensive margin
elasticities are uniformly increased (in absolute terms) by 0.1.

![Figure 57: Price elasticities of energy demand in
CPAT](./03/media/image12.png)

The initial source for price elasticities is a meta-study by Labandeira
and others (2017). This includes about 2,000 empirically estimated
elasticities from 430 studies with broad global coverage of countries,
seven fuels, and four sectors (refer to Table A for descriptive
statistics). ‘Target’ estimates of elasticities for fuels and sectors
are estimated, assuming that the base is the transport sector, plus
deviations for the residential, industrial and services sectors (Table
B)[^3_21]. For any statistically insignificant values for fuels within
sectoral regressions (natural gas in residential, for example), it is
assumed that the difference between sectoral and base elasticities equal
that sectors’ general elasticities multiplied by a scalar for all energy
sources.

Additionally, there is evidence that price elasticities are slightly
higher for developing countries (about 10%; Labandeira, Labeaga, and
López-Otero 2017). Price elasticities are therefore adjusted slightly
upwards for developing countries (on the extensive margin) such that
they are a similar magnitude higher than for developed countries.

Simple price elasticities (rounded to 1 decimal point) on both the
intensive and extensive margin are then calibrated to those targets. As
shown in Table C, when weighting for developed and developing countries’
emissions, elasticities in CPAT are very similar (within 10%) to these
target elasticities.

Table 3‑2: Comparison of price elasticities

![Figure 58: Comparison of price elasticities](./03/media/image13.png)

These, price elasticities are sense checked both against a large
database of price elasticities (covering around 250 studies and 2,500
price elasticities), as well as through model intercomparison of CPAT
results compared with those of other models. Both the baseline emissions
projections and price responsiveness of emissions is broadly in line
with that of other models, while median price elasticities are not
significantly different for fuel-sector pairs collected across countries
(though there is variation).

Lastly, all elasticities are long-term elasticities.

#### Rebound effect

When prices change, energy consumers also shift to more efficient
energy-consuming goods. Marginal costs of fuel consumption are lower for
more efficient goods (e.g. each km travelled is cheaper for a vehicle
with higher fuel economy), hence there is a corresponding increase in
demand for those same fuels (‘direct rebound effect’). As marginal costs
of fuel consumption decline, consumers also increase the intensity of
consumption of these capital goods (e.g. travel more miles in vehicles).

![](./03/media/image13.png)*Table* *3‑3: Implied direct rebound effects
from prices (endogenous efficiency improvements increasing demand for
energy)*

The energy use equation outlined in Section 3.3 allows rebound effects,
$\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U} \right),$ to be captured and compared to
econometric estimates of rebound. Broadly, these align with the
empirical literature. More specifically, the rebound effect is defined
as the product of the energy efficiency elasticity and the usage
elasticity, $\epsilon_{F}*\epsilon_{U}$, as follows in the term
affecting prices change:

$\left( \frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F} + \epsilon_{U} + \epsilon_{F}*\epsilon_{U}}$

With $\epsilon_{F} = \epsilon_{U} = - 0.3$, the rebound effect
represents 15.5% (i.e. the rebound effect reduces the total price
elasticity by 15.5%). This result is lower, but seems more reasonable,
than the estimates in a meta-analysis of 74 studies in Dimitropoulos and
others (26-29% rebound effect, 2018).

The estimated leakage effects in residential natural gas (31%) are
similar to those found in studies (20% to 30%, Haas and Biermayr 2000).

#### Cross-price elasticities

CPAT contains three substitution or cross-price elasticities to account
for the risk that households that face increases in costs for
residential heating and cooking fuels shift to informal fuels like
biomass. This ‘leakage’ effect can have a negative impact on household
air pollution and hence welfare, which is calculated by CPAT’s air
pollution module. These cross-price elasticities (biomass with respect
to LPG and kerosene, as well gasoline with respect to diesel) are
parameterized to the same broad literature review.

Table 3‑4: Cross-price elasticities of substitution in CPAT

![Figure 60: Cross-price elasticities of substitution in
CPAT](./03/media/image14.png)

#### Rates of technological change and exogenous rebound effects

The annual rate of exogenous technological change (that is, not induced
by policies under consideration in CPAT) are set at between 0.5 and 1
percent per year for each fuel-sector pair.

Table 3‑5: Exogenous efficiency improvements in energy-consuming capital
goods (cars, buildings, factories)

![Figure 61: Exogenous efficiency improvements in energy-consuming
capital goods (cars, buildings, factories)](./03/media/image15.png)

It should be noted that – as with efficiency induced endogenously by
price changes – exogenous efficiency improvements reduce marginal costs
of energy consumption, hence there is some rebound effect that partly
offsets the reduction in demand from improved efficiency. A large
literature exists that examines the rebound effect from efficiency
improvements, with estimates varying significantly, from 0 to 300%
(Saunders et al. 2021). In CPAT, this rebound from exogenous efficiency
improvements depends on the fuel-sector pair and its corresponding
intensive margin and efficiency, but broadly it is between 20% to 60%
across fuels and sectors.

emissions reduction reduced)

emissions reduction reduced)](./03/media/image16.png)

## Power sector models

The mitigation module has two models that can be used for the
electricity sector: the elasticity-based model and the techno-economic
(‘engineer’) model. The user can choose to use the elasticity,
engineer model, or a simple average of the two models. We recommend the
‘average’ model for ‘off-the-shelf’ use of CPAT and the engineer model
for more tailored usages and for non-marginal changes (like a high CO2
tax policy). Before presenting the two models, it is essential to note
that by default, prices and generation costs are applied to both the
techno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models. The
main differences are as follows:

  - **The 'elasticity-based' model** uses marginal increases in fuel
    prices and price elasticities to determine the shares of each
    generation type. It is simple, transparently parameterized, easily
    explainable, and easily deployable in an Excel spreadsheet model
    used in previous versions of CPAT and IMF tools.

  - **The ‘engineer model'** explicitly models the capacity of different
    generation types, with capacity[^3_22] expanding to meet desired
    power demand. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is allocated
    according to marginal price, with a sigmoidal function of relative
    price. Investment is also a function of levelized cost, with a
    system penalty for the cost of integrating high levels of renewable
    penetration. Transmission losses are modeled as a fixed quantity of
    total generation. The model allows modeling decisions changing the
    stock of assets in the power sector (investment and retirement) and
    decisions changing the use of assets for power generation
    (dispatch). In addition, the model allows the user to define a
    constraint on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate. The
    rates reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation
    in VRE additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in
    gross additions, not net of retirements). The model is consistent
    with countries' generation capacities and makes it possible to
    investigate the radically different power systems consistent with
    high carbon prices, while the empirical 'elasticity-based' model is
    valid only for more marginal changes.

In what follows, Section 3.4.1 defines power prices and generation
costs, Section 3.4.2 describes the techno-economic model, and Section
3.4.3 the elasticity-based model. Finally, Section 3.4.4 presents the
parameter choices of the power models.

### Power prices and generation costs

This section describes the determination of generation costs and power
prices in CPAT. These prices and generation costs are applied to the
techno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models.
However, in the latter case, the user has an alternative option to use a
simpler set of prices based on the original IMF board paper, which are
not covered here.

#### Overview

Power generation costs have the following components:

  - Variable (per kWh) operations and maintenance costs;
  - Fixed (per MW) operations and maintenance costs;
  - Decommissioning and waste disposal costs;
  - Fuel cost before the introduction of the carbon pricing policy;
  - Existing or new renewables subsidies;
  - Existing or new carbon price or other policy (feebate, excise duty
    on electricity); and
  - Systems cost of integration, modeled as short+long-term storage
    costs as a function of variable renewable energy (VRE; meaning
    wind+solar+other renewables, but not including hydro or biomass)
    share.

In addition, we impose an implicit price of coal relative to gas,
reflecting unobserved environmental regulations on coal and the superior
flexibility of gas. These aspects are not fully captured in a model as
simple as this. We calibrate this price on observed coal shares and
future (IEA) projections (see Section 3.4.2.4).

End-user (industrial and residential) power prices additionally have the
following components:

  - Estimated transmission and distribution costs (different for
    industry and residential);
  - Net historical subsidy or tax (estimated either via a price gap or
    via independent data if provided by the user);
  - Any correction for under- or over-estimated transmission and
    distribution costs (exists only if we have concrete subsidy data);
  - New carbon tax as imposed on the generation types and passed on to
    the end user; and
  - Any electricity excise or rebate of the carbon price
    (Feebates/Output-based-rebating).

#### Notation

The tables below present the notations used in the section and the name
of the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are
reported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made
to ensure that they match our calculations.

The first table gives overarching concepts relating to power generation.

#### Power generation cost and price concepts

We use four different power generation cost/price concepts in CPAT:

  - **Current Variable Costs**: For dispatch decisions the current
    variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and
    maintenance).
  - **Levelized Cost of Investment**: For forward looking (investment)
    decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all
    cost components is used. For example, one part is *forward-looking
    expectations* of future fuel and carbon costs.
  - **Cost-recovery generation cost**: For estimating the total running
    cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is
    estimated. This includes current variable cost, running amortization
    of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and other components
    too). The cost-recovery generation cost by generation type is
    averaged and then transmission and distribution costs added to
    produce an overall estimate cost of generating and distributing
    electricity.
  - **End user power prices** (residential and industrial): these are
    based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost
    changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of
    changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also
    choose to phase out estimated electricity subsidy.

#### Concept 1: Current variable costs

Variable costs are used in the dispatch decision directly between gas
and coal.[^3_23]

Current variable costs are defined as the sum of the following cost
components:

$vc_{\text{ocft}} = \text{vo}p_{\text{ocft}} + fc_{\text{ocft}} + ip_{\text{cft}} = \text{vo}p_{\text{ocft}} + \frac{p_{\text{ocft}}}{\nu_{\text{cf}}} + ip_{\text{cft}}$

where:

  - $\text{vop}$ represents variable costs for operating and
    maintenance, that is variable OpEx in USD per kWh.
  - $\text{fc}$ denotes projected unit fuel costs before the
    introduction of the carbon pricing policy. These costs are
    calculated as the ratio of pre-tax prices (including producer-side
    subsidies) $\text{ps}$ and thermal efficiency $\nu$:
    $\frac{ps_{\text{cft}}}{\nu_{\text{cf}}}$. It is worth noting that
    no improvements in time is currently modeled. By default, fuel costs
    are considered as a moving average over a 5-year window. The option
    to use spot prices can be enabled in the dashboard:

![](./03/media/image17.png)

Figure 3‑11: Dashboard: Use Spot Fuel Prices in Engineer Power Model

  - $\text{ip}c_{\text{cft}}$ denotes an implicit price component for
    coal. Note that this latter component could be turned off in the
    settings and not taken into account (for more information, see
    Section 3.4.2.4).

#### Concept 2: Levelized costs of generation (Forward-looking)

##### General approach

  - LCOEs by generation type are estimated as a forward-looking
    (discounted cashflow) approach.
  - Note these is different from the cost-recovery prices above as the
    cost-recovery approach uses an amortization of capital costs and
    running interest costs rather than discounting.
  - Fuel and carbon costs in these LCOEs are forward-looking, meaning
    they are the discounted value of future cashflows assuming full
    confidence in the proposed policy and full foresight.

Forward-looking generation costs are defined using a levelized cost of
electricity (LCOE) methodology, which relies on discounting at the
appropriate discount rate. Levelized cost enables the comparison of
different energy technologies with different characteristics (operating
lifetime, capacity factor, construction cost, and time) on an equivalent
basis. To the levelized cost, we add system integration costs. The
levelized cost can be defined, in general, as the discounted sum of
costs divided by the discounted sum of electricity produced. Let’s
assume that a generation technology produces power for $N$ years, and
we start counting at year zero (so there are $N$ payments, with the
first being $t_{0}$ and last being $t = N - 1$. We separate the
components $q$ (capital cost) of the levelized costs, which can be
treated equivalently. For each component $q$ of the levelized cost:

$\text{LCO}E_{q} = \frac{PV_{q}}{\text{dem}} = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \text{rt}}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}}$

where $PV_{q}$ is the present value of costs, $\text{dem}$ is the
discounted power produced, $g_{t}$ is the power produced at time $t$
and $C_{q,t}$ is the $q$ component of costs at time $t$, breaking
down into the following components:

The full investment cost contains the following components:

  - Capital expenditure
  - Decommissioning (all generation types) and waste disposal cost
    (nuclear only)
  - Variable OpEx
  - Fixed OpEx
  - Fuel Cost Before Carbon Price
  - Marginal system cost of storage (see next section)
  - Carbon Price
  - Implicit cost of coal

Each of these components is calculated using the levelized cost formula
above. Almost all components are either fixed or increasing/decreasing
at a fixed rate. In that case we can use a geometric series
approximation. See the appendices for a derivation.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is by default
income-dependent:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><blockquote>
<p><strong>Income Level</strong></p>
</blockquote></th>
<th><blockquote>
<p><strong>WACC Assumed</strong></p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p>LIC</p>

<td><blockquote>
<p>0.150</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The WACC can also be technology-dependent, i.e. it can be specified for
each technology. At the same time, the WACC can be specified for the
baseline and the policy scenario. Finally, the WACC can be defined
globally by the user.

The levelized total investment costs is defined as:

$\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cf}} = \frac{vc_{P,\text{cft}}*cf_{\text{cf}}*\text{df}c_{\text{cft}}}{cf_{\text{cf}}*\text{df}c_{\text{cft}}} + \text{fi}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{fl}}$

where $\text{df}c_{\text{cft}}$ is the discount factor
$1 + \text{wac}c_{\text{cft}}^{t - t_{0}}$ and
$\text{fi}x^{\text{fl}}$ denotes the forward-looking levelized fixed
costs, which is calculated as:

$\text{fi}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{fl}} = \frac{\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}}{cf_{\text{cf}}*365*24*\text{dl}f_{\text{cft}}} + \frac{\text{dt}c_{\text{cft}}}{cf_{\text{cf}}*365*24*\text{dl}f_{\text{cft}}} + \text{st}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{op}f_{\text{cft}} + \text{pusRe}n_{\text{cft}}$

where $\text{cax}$ is the capital cost, $\text{dtc}$ is th
decommissioning total cost, $\text{sto}$ is the cost of storage,
$\text{fro}$ correspond to fixed costs for operating and maintenance,
$\text{dl}f_{\text{cft}}$ denoting the discounted lifetime of each
generation type $f$ and $\text{re}s_{\text{cft}}$ reflects the
per-unit renewable subsidies (if added).

In the dashboard, the following option allows the user to specify
renewable subsidy under a baseline and policy scenarios:

![](./03/media/image18.png)

Figure 3‑12: Dashboard: Renewable subsidy ($/kwh in nominal terms)

After the introduction of the carbon pricing policy, the current total
cost is:

$\text{LCO}E_{P,\text{cft}} = vc_{P,\text{cft}} + \text{fi}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{fl}}$

where
$vc_{P,\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\text{cft}} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cft}}$.

##### LCOE methodology: Simplification

As mentioned in the main text:

$\text{LCO}E_{q} = \frac{PV_{q}}{g} = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \text{rt}}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}}$

where $PV_{q}$ is the present value of costs, $g$ is the discounted
power produced, $g_{t}$ is the power produced at time $t$ and
$C_{q,t}$ is the $q$ component of costs at time $t$, breaking down
into various components described in the above section.

There is a simplification in the case of **constant growth rates**. If
at and after time $n$ the residual components of the cashflow have
consistent real (logarithmic) growth rate $\tau$, i.e.,
$C_{t} = C_{n}e^{g\left( t - n \right)}$, then they form a geometric
series, which can be summed analytically:

$\begin{matrix}
\text{PVofCosts} & = \sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \text{rt}} + \sum_{t = n}^{N - 1}C_{n}e^{- \text{rn}}\left( e^{\tau - r} \right)^{t - n} & & & \\
\end{matrix}$

$= \sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \text{rn}}\sum_{t = n}^{N - 1}\left( e^{\tau - r} \right)^{t - n}$

$= \sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \text{rn}}\sum_{t = 0}^{N - n - 1}\left( e^{\tau - r} \right)^{t}$

$= \sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \text{rn}}\frac{1 - \left( e^{\tau - r} \right)^{N - n}}{1 - \left( e^{\tau - r} \right)}$

If a component is fixed in time, i.e. $\tau = 0$ and $n = 0$,
there’s a further simplification:

$\text{PVofCosts} = C_{n}e^{- \text{rn}}\frac{1 - \left( e^{\tau - r} \right)^{N - n}}{1 - \left( e^{\tau - r} \right)} = C_{0}\frac{1 - e^{- \text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}$

$\begin{matrix}
\text{LCOE} & = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}} & = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{0}e^{\text{τt}}e^{- \text{rt}}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}} & = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{0}\left( e^{\tau - r} \right)^{t}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \text{rt}}} & = \frac{C_{0}\frac{1 - e^{- \text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}}{g_{0}\frac{1 - e^{- \text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}} & = \frac{C_{0}}{g_{0}} \\
\end{matrix}$

#### Concept 3: Cost-recovery estimated total cost of generation

  - Generation costs are modeled by component (CapEx, OpEx, Fuel costs
    etc). These are ‘cost recovery prices’ assuming amortization of
    CapEx, interest costs and so on.
  - Weighted average generation costs are then augmented by global
    assumptions on transmission costs, to give estimated cost recovery
    price.
  - Then the cost recovery price is compared to observed prices and the
    difference attributed to being a tax or subsidy (if no independent
    subsidy data is available) or an under/overestimated cost if
    independent (user entered) subsidy-data is available.
  - For cost recovery, a weighted average CapEx of the capital stock is
    needed. For most generation types, the CapEx per MW is constant, but
    for renewable energies it declines rapidly so the weighted average
    invested amount per MW is estimated by taking a weighted average of
    the current running total with the cost of new additions.

The current generation cost before tax, $\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cft}}$,
is thus composed of both variable and fixed costs:

$\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\text{cft}} + \text{fi}x_{\text{cft}}$

where $\text{vc}$ denotes current variable costs (defined in an
earlier section) and $\text{fix}$ denotes amortized fixed costs.

Amortized fixed cost is the sum of the following elements:

$\text{fi}x_{B,\text{cft}} = \text{ac}c_{\text{cft}} + \text{in}t_{\text{cft}} + \text{de}c_{\text{cft}} + \text{st}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{op}f_{\text{cft}}$

Where:

  - $\text{acc}$ is the yearly amortization of capital costs per kWh
    produced:
    $\frac{\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{av}}}{\text{cf}*365*24*\text{li}f_{f}}$
    with $\text{ca}x^{\text{av}}$ the weighted average CapEx,
    $\text{cf}$ the assumed capacity factor and $\text{lif}$ the
    lifetime for each fuel. The weighted average CapEx is defined as:
    $\text{ca}x_{\text{cf},t - 1}^{\text{av}}*\left( 1 - \Phi_{\text{inv}} \right) + \text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}*\Phi_{\text{inv}}$
    with $\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}$ the CapEx and $\Phi_{\text{inv}}$
    the new investment expressed as a proportion of total existing
    capacity less retirements. It is worth noting that the base year,
    $t_{0}$, corresponds to $\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}$. Over time,
    the CapEx is not varying, except for renewables (for more
    information see Section 3.4.4.4).

  - $\text{int}$ is the interest costs per kWh produced, assuming a
    straight-line amortization of CapEx:
    $0.5*\frac{\text{ca}x_{\text{cft}}^{\text{av}}*\text{wac}c_{\text{cf}}}{cf_{\text{cf}}*365*24}$
    where $\text{wacc}$ is the WACC. The WACC can be adjusted
    according to different settings and both under a baseline and policy
    scenarios.

  - $\text{dec}$ denotes the yearly amortization of decommissioning
    costs[^3_24] per kWh produced:
    $\frac{\text{dt}c_{B,\text{cft}}}{cf_{B,\text{cf}}*365*24*\text{li}f_{f}}$
    where $\text{dt}c_{\text{cft}}$ denotes the decommissioning and
    transmission costs in USD per kW (for more information see Section
    3.4.4.4).

  - $\text{sto}$ defines the weighted average storage cost of
    vintages, which corresponds to the marginal storage costs for
    renewable energies.

  - Finally, $\text{opf}$ represents fixed costs for operating and
    maintenance, that is fixed OpEx expressed in USD per kWh according
    to the capacity factor of each fuel:
    $\frac{\text{tf}c_{\text{cft}}}{365*24*cf_{\text{cf}}}$ where
    $\text{tfc}$ is the fixed OpEx expressed in USD per kWy.

#### Concept 4: End-user prices

  - End-user prices are taken to be equal to current prices plus any
    change in underlying generation cost.
  - *Observed* power prices are used as the basis of the demand model.
  - *Changes* in generation costs (including those caused by carbon
    prices and any due to the phase-out of aforementioned subsidies) are
    assumed to be passed on to consumers (the proportion of pass-on
    defaults to 100% but can be altered.). If the parameter setting
    price controls is set to not one (could be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) then
    all price changes (from technology changes or carbon price) are
    diminished in the same proportion.

To estimate power prices (i.e. before the policy tax is introduced), the
weighted current generation cost is calculated as follows:

$\text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} = \sum_{f}^{}gns_{B,\text{cft}}*\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cft}}$

For each country, the weighted average of generation cost
$\text{gn}c_{B,c}^{\text{av}}$ is calculated according to generation
shares $\text{gn}s_{B,\text{cft}}$ of each fuel $f$ and their
respective current generation cost $\text{gn}c_{B,\text{cf}}$.

In the engineer model, power prices are processed specifically in the
residential and non-residential sector (i.e. industrial sector). The
supply price in the technoeconomic model $sp_{B,\text{cg}}^{T}$ (where
the index $T$ holds for technoeconomic model) is determined in the
residential and industrial sectors
($g = \text{Residential},\text{Industrial}$) via a fixed positive
increment corresponding to transmission cost ($\text{tmc}$) to the
weighted average generation cost such as:

$sp_{B,\text{cg}}^{T} = \text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} + \text{tmc}$

An allowance of $15/MWh and $40/MWh was added to account for
transmission and distribution costs for industrial and residential uses,
respectively[^3_25].

A markup $\text{mu}$ is then calculated specifically for residential
and industrial electricity prices to equalize the starting year price
(i.e. historical retail prices in the electricity sector,
$\text{hr}p_{\text{cg}}$), as follows:

$mu_{B,\text{cgt}}^{T} = \text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} + \text{tmc} - \text{hr}p_{\text{cg}}.$

It is worth noting that when the markup is negative (i.e. retail prices
are lower than modeled supply prices), the model captures a subsidy.

Carbon taxes are applied at the fuel-input stage to each generation.
However, for the purposes of the overall generation cost, those costs
are excluded as part of the generation cost average and averaged, and
added on, separately. This is for the reason that doing this way allows
us to calculate easily a needed rebate when rebating is employed.

The final residential and industrial end user power price in the
technoeconomic power model, $p_{P,\text{cg}}^{T}$, is calculated as
follows when a carbon price, $\text{nc}p_{\text{cg}}$, power excise,
$\text{pe}x_{P,\text{cgt}}$, a rebate, $\text{re}b_{\text{cg}}$, are
introduced:

$p_{P,\text{cgt}}^{T} = \text{gn}c_{B,\text{ct}}^{\text{av}} + \text{nc}p_{\text{cgt}} - \text{re}b_{P,\text{cgt}} + \text{pe}x_{P,\text{cgt}} + \text{tmc} + mu_{B,\text{cgt}}^{T}$

At this stage two end-user power price settings are included:

  - Output Based Rebating: the total carbon price is added to the
    generation types and then subtracted from overall power prices so
    that the overall policy is revenue-neutral.
  - Electricity Excise: a per-kwh tax is *added* at the end-user stage

### Techno-economic (‘engineer’) power model

#### Overview

Electricity is widely acknowledged to be critical to ‘deep
decarbonization’ scenarios, in the sense that alternatives such as
renewables primarily generate electricity instead of solid, liquid, or
gaseous energy vectors. Deep decarbonization involves decarbonizing the
existing power sector and electrifying sectors that currently use fossil
fuels directly. Electrification will also involve expanding the power
sector to accommodate the increased power demand from this shift in
energy vector. Such a structural model is important for the following
reasons:

  - **Marginal versus radical**. Elasticity-based models are arguably
    best suited to price-based demand-side effects of marginal increases
    in fuel prices. They are less well suited to the non-marginal
    changes required for deep-decarbonization Paris-compliant scenarios.
  - **Within bounds of equipment**. Power systems involve two
    significant sets of decisions: decisions that change the stock of
    power generation assets (investment and retirement) and decisions
    that change the use of those assets for electricity generation
    (dispatch). Without determining the capital stock, it is unclear
    that a particular choice of generation is consistent with the actual
    generation capacities of a specific country. An elasticity-based
    approach can produce non-physically realistic results (i.e., power
    dispatched that requires implicit investment rates faster than what
    is realistic).
  - **Responsiveness to absolute levels of renewable costs**.
    Elasticity-based models can be unresponsive to actual levels of
    costs since it is based principally on the changes in cost.
  - **Using accurate, referenced generation cost data**. The
    elasticity-based model used data that was at times not clearly
    referenced and not recently updated. For example, the percentage of
    non-fuel costs in total coal generation costs seems inconsistent
    between the spreadsheet and the published IMF paper. Neither are
    directly referenced against currently published costs.
  - **Renewables costs are rapidly changing**, and it is helpful to
    model this explicitly.
  - **The model should include, and the outcomes depend on, carbon
    price-dependent switching carbon prices for generation and
    investment**. It’s helpful to know the ‘switching cost’ (for
    example, between coal and gas) in terms of the dispatch decision and
    the investment decision as a valuable marker of required carbon
    taxes to begin decarbonization.
  - **Modeling the new reality**. According to Bloomberg New Energy
    Finance data, newly built renewables have already achieved
    cost-parity with newly built fossil fuel plants in many parts of the
    world. Consequently, the near future is likely to look very
    different from the past, even without any policy-led acceleration of
    the deployment of renewables. Indeed, the recent deployment of
    renewables has tended to surprise on the upside (e.g., actual
    deployment has tended to outpace IEA projections). It’s unclear
    whether an elasticity-based model can fully capture these rapidly
    changing dynamics.

**Summary of algorithm**

As mentioned previously, the model has four types of prices:

  - **Current Variable Costs**: For dispatch decisions, the current
    variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and
    maintenance).
  - **Levelized Cost of Investment**: For forward-looking (investment)
    decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all
    cost components is used. For example, one part is *forward-looking
    expectations* of future fuel and carbon costs.
  - **Cost-recovery generation cost**: For estimating the total running
    cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is
    calculated. This includes current variable cost, running
    amortization of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and
    other components too). The cost-recovery generation cost by
    generation type is averaged and then transmission and distribution
    costs are added to produce an overall estimated cost of generating
    and distributing electricity.
  - **End user power prices** (residential and industrial): these are
    based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost
    changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of
    changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also
    choose to phase out the estimated electricity subsidy.

The outlines of the algorithm are as follows:

1.  End-user prices and GDP changes drive power demand by CPAT sector.
    (Some components of these prices are lagged one year to avoid
    circularity as Excel uses sequential rather than optimizing logic.)

2.  According to historical energy balance data, transmission losses,
    own use, and net exports are added as fixed proportions of
    aggregated power demand.

3.  Current inflexible capacity (renewable, nuclear) are assumed to
    dispatch at historical capacity factors, and the remainder is
    allocated to coal and gas according to available capacity using a
    logit formula based on variable cost.

4.  Old capacity is retired according to either to defined data on
    retirement schedules (coal) or an exponential process (other
    generation types), with cost-based early retirement also included
    and an option to schedule retirement of coal.

5.  Aggregate new generation capacity is added to meet expected demand
    assuming historical capacity factors.

6.  Renewables are assumed to require both short- and long-duration
    storage, with assumed piecewise-quadratic total storage
    requirements, implying piecewise-linear marginal storage
    requirements. These storage requirements are approximately modelled
    based on global technical models. These storage costs are added to
    generation costs for Variable Renewable generation types.

7.  Needed additions to aggregate ‘effective’ capacity (i.e. additions
    to expected generation) are then allocated according to another
    logit formalism based on total levelized costs by generation type,
    with the cheapest generation types taking the main share of the
    investment.

8.  Renewables also have a maximum scale-up rate, set by default to 2
    percentage points of total generation for wind and solar
    additional-generation. This setting can be changed by the user.
    Needed capacity beyond the limits are reallocated to other
    generation types according to the logit proportions. If there is
    still an unmet need for generation (for example in a high-hydro
    situation where new hydro investment is prohibited), the model will
    *in extremis* override VRE scaleup limits and the allowed investment
    types and invest in proportion to the current proportions of
    capacity in the system.

9.  Capacities after retirement and new investment are passed forward as
    the starting point of the model for the next year.

#### Power demand

The power demand, $E_{\text{cgt}}$, determines the total quantity of
power demanded by sector. At present, our power demand is determined the
same way as the equations outlined in Section 3.3.3, with fuel type
equal to power (electricity) ($f = P$):

$\frac{E_{\text{ocsf},t}}{E_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \left( \frac{1}{1 + \alpha_{\text{sf}}} \right)^{1 + \epsilon_{U,\text{sf}}}\Psi_{\text{ct}}\left( \frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{G,\text{csf}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{csf}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{csf}}\left( 1 + \epsilon_{U,\text{csf}} \right)}$

where $E$ is expressed in ktoe, $Y$ is the total real GDP,
$\alpha$, the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement. The
prices $p$ correspond to total (industrial and residential) power
prices, as in Section 3.3.3). These prices respond to changes in
weighted total generation cost, which is lagged by one year to avoid
circularity issue.

A Covid adjustment factor to power demand $\Psi$ can be taken into
account (see Section 3.3.4.4 - note this is specifically calibrated for
the engineer model). Note that additional policies affecting the
parameter $\alpha$ can be manually added.

That power demand from the elasticity model can also be used (it is very
similar, just not disaggregated by sector):

![Figure 41: Mitigation: Use Elasticity Model Power Demand In Engineer
Model](./03/media/image20.png)

Figure 3‑14: Mitigation: Use Elasticity Model Power Demand In Engineer
Model

The total generation requirement (in ktoe), $g_{\text{oc},t}$, is
therefore calculated as the sum of the total demand of all sectors
augmented (subtracted) by the proportion – based on the base year – of
net exports (imports), $\text{ne}t_{\text{oc},t_{0}}$, the energy
industry’s own use, $\text{ei}u_{\text{oc},t_{0}}$, and transmission
and statistical differences, $\Delta_{t_{0}}^{\text{dif}}$:

$g_{\text{oc},t} = \sum_{s}^{}E_{\text{ocs},t}*\left( 1 + \text{ne}t_{\text{oc},t_{0}} + \text{ei}u_{c,t_{0}} + \Delta_{c,t_{0}}^{\text{dif}} \right)$

#### Power supply

##### Logit function

Two different cost-based decisions are considered in the engineer model:
the dispatch decision, determining how existing power plants are used,
and new investment planning. In both of these decisions, the
‘multilogit’ function is used, with the probability of investment
and dispatch of a technology increasing as a function of the price
differential with alternatives. A parameter $K$ adjusts the shape of
the sigmoidal function that can be refined upon review of leading power
sector models employing a similar approach. They determine the speed of
transitioning between generation types with a different cost. The $K$
parameters are set with defaults set subjectively at 2 for both dispatch
and investment, which we believe produces realistic results. This
parameter can be adjusted in the dashboard:

![](./03/media/image21.png)

Figure 3‑15: Dashboard: K parameters

The formula of the multilogit is as follows:

$\frac{x_{\text{ocft}}}{\sum_{f}^{}x_{\text{ocft}}} = \frac{e^{- K.c}}{\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K.c}}$

where $\frac{x_{\text{ocft}}}{\sum_{f}^{}x_{\text{ocft}}}$ is the
proportion (i.e. investment, $x = \text{inv}$, or generation
$x = \text{gen}$) allocated to generation type $f$, and $c_{i}$ is
the relative cost of generation type $f$ (i.e. the total levelized
cost of electricity in the case of investment or variable costs $i$.

##### Dispatch decision

Dispatch decisions are based on a multi-step process.

The model first determines generation from nuclear, renewables, biomass
and oil according to their capacity factor and the total supply
required. In particular, renewables are assumed to produce power
according to their installed capacity multiplied by historical capacity
factors.

In the case of renewables, they are assumed to be non-dispatchable
meaning their capacity factor is fixed. Nuclear, biomass, and oil
generation are assumed to be semi-dispatchable meaning that if power
demand falls relative to the base year, they too will reduce their
capacity factor proportionally. But they will not increase their
capacity factor. For nuclear, the low variable cost makes it economical
always to run the plant when available. For biomass and oil, we simplify
as we do not wish to model merit order decisions with many different
fact (hourly peaking needs, environmental regulations etc).

Then, residual energy demand is determined by an explicit choice between
coal and gas based on the variable cost of each (including the carbon
tax). In other words, the remaining generation needed after nuclear,
renewables, biomass and oil generation are subtracted, is allocated to
coal and gas.

$\text{reqge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COA} + \text{GAS},t} = g_{\text{oc},t} - \sum_{\text{fϵ}\left( \text{RE},\text{NUC} \right)}^{}cap_{f}*cf_{f}$

First, we determine the minimum coal needed assuming gas runs at maximum
capacity and vice versa for coal. The maximum capacity is by default set
to 90%, but the user can adjust it in the dashboard:

![Figure 44: Dashboard: Use energy balances or (CPAT) energy consumption
data](./03/media/image22.png)

Figure 3‑16: Energy balances and energy consumption

For example, for coal:

$\text{minge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t} = \text{reqge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COAL} + \text{GAS},t} - \text{ca}p_{\text{GAS}}*\text{maxC}f_{\text{GAS}}$

Then, the remaining required generation after these minima are allocated
to coal and natural gas, $g_{f}$, is determined based on their
relative marginal costs, using the logit formulation:

$\lambda_{f} = \frac{e^{- K_{\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}{\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}$

where $f$ is restricted to coal or natural gas and $\lambda_{f}$ is
the proportion of the residual generation (after the ‘minimum coal’ and
minimum gas’ allocation given limited capacity of the other) allocated
to each of coal and gas. The term $H_{g}$ is the ratio
$\frac{vc_{P,\text{cft}}}{vc_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}}$, where the
(marginal) variable cost is given by $vc_{P,\text{cft}}$ and
$vc_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}$ is the variable cost of the lowest
cost option between coal and natural gas,
i.e. $f \in \left\{ \text{coal},\text{naturalgas} \right\}$, and
$K_{g}$ is the K parameter specific to generation.

Power generation for coal thus becomes:

$g_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t} = \text{minge}n_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t} + \lambda_{f}*\text{residualreqge}n_{\text{oc},\frac{\text{COA}}{\text{GAS}},t}$

where $\text{residualreqgen}$ denotes the residual power generation
from coal and gas.

This procedure gives overall raw generation shares (assuming no PPAs),
${\widetilde{\gamma}}_{\text{ocf},t}$. It is worth noting that to the
extent PPAs exist, a fixed capacity factor is used. Therefore, the
latter is downscaled if the ‘needed’ coal and gas generation is less
than what is implied by their default capacity factors. The total
generation mix becomes:

$\gamma_{\text{ocf},t} = \left( 1 - \omega_{\text{oct}} \right)*{\widetilde{\gamma}}_{\text{ocf},t} + \omega_{\text{oct}}*\Omega*\left( \text{ca}p_{\text{ocft}}*CF_{\text{cft}} \right)$

where $\gamma_{\text{ocf},t}$ is the generation share after PPAs
$\omega$ denotes the percentage PPAs and $\Omega$ a downscaling
factor if needed generation is different from that which is determined
by the raw capacity factors.

##### Retirement and capacity needed

At the start of the analysis, the capital stock is based on electricity
generation capacity data by fuel type from Enerdata. Required effective
capacity is equal to expected generation capacity and is defined as
capacity multiplied by the expected capacity factor -– i.e., the
investment is set such that the capacity is sufficient to cover expected
peak demand, which is estimated using the power demand equation (see
Section 3.4.2.2).

The economic system is expected to plan ahead a few years in advance so
that investment takes place to meet the projected demand at the start of
each year at the same time as retirement is modeled to happen. Capacity
for the first year is thus determined based on IEA data.

For the following years, new capacity is thus equal to the old capacity,
less retirements, and plus any new investments needed. The total
required generation capacity is given by the expected power demand minus
the generation capacity (last year’s capacity less retirements):

$g_{\text{ocft}} = g_{\text{ocf},t - 1} - \sum_{f}^{}ret_{ocf,t - 1} + inv_{ofc,t - 1}$

It is assumed that a generation dependent proportion, $\text{ret}$, of
all generation assets retire each year, equal to the reciprocal of the
average lifetime $\text{lif}$ of that generation type.

$\text{re}t_{\text{ocft}} = \frac{1}{\text{lif}}*\text{ca}p_{\text{ocft}}$

For coal, it is worth noting that planned retirement is adjusted based
on the coal power plant tracker, which provides power plant data level
for a number of countries. Therefore, based on these data, the
retirement year of each power plant is determined and the capacity
associated is determined from 2022 to 2050[^3_26]. When data do not
exist, the above formula is used.

In addition to planned retirement, cost-based early retirement coal is
also estimated as additional policies could accelerate retirement for
coal power plants. In this respect, the model:

  - First finds the maximum of coal that could be replaced by wind and
    solar. The maximum coal retirement is estimated as a fixed
    proportion (default 80%) of coal total effective capacity.
  - Second, it compares the variable cost of coal with the total cost of
    wind and solar.
  - Third, it calculates through a logit formula a proportion of the
    maximum coal replacement (depending on relative costs):

$\text{re}p_{\text{oc},\text{coa},t} = 1 - \frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,\text{COA}}}}{\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,f}}}$

where $H_{r,\text{coa}}$ is the ratio
$\frac{vc_{\text{oc},\text{coa},t}}{vc_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{lc}}}$ and
$H_{r,f}$ is the ratio
$\frac{vc_{\text{ocft}}}{vc_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{lc}}}$ with
$f \in \left\{ \text{coal},\text{solar},\text{wind} \right\}$. The
term $\text{re}p_{\text{oc},\text{COA},t}$ denotes the proportion of
coal replacement.

Finally, the estimated proportion $\text{re}p_{c,\text{coa},t}$ is
multiplied by the maximum of coal retirement.

Therefore, the total retirement is equal to the sum of planned
retirement and cost-based early retirement.

##### Investment decision and non-VRE and VRE scale up limitations

Investment decisions are constrained by non-VRE and VRE limits and are
based on two rounds:

  - New investments permitted: A logit function capped by a VRE limit
    that spreads out investments across technologies based on the
    cheapest levelized costs.

  - Allocated remaining capacity needed: A least-cost merit order
    algorithm allocates remaining capacity needed according to
    generation costs across technologies.
    
      - Logit function constrained by scale-up limits

Similarly as dispatch and retirement, new investment is spread out
across the cheapest levelized possibilities, according to a multilogit
formulation (with K parameter = 2):

$\frac{\text{iv}p_{\text{ocft}}}{\sum_{f}^{}{\text{iv}p_{\text{ocft}}}} = \zeta_{\text{cft}}*\frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}{\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}$

Where: $\zeta_{\text{cft}}$ stands for new investments permitted in
percentage. The user has the possibility to enable new investments (in
MW). $\text{iv}p_{\text{cft}}$ denotes the proportion of new
investments $K_{i}$ the K parameter specific to investment decisions.
The term $H_{i}$ is the ratio
$\frac{\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}}{\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}}$,
$\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}$ and
$\text{ti}c_{P,\text{cft}}^{\text{lc}}$ define, respectively, the
levelized investment cost and the lowest levelized investment cost
across fuel types. It is important to note that renewables face a
penalty at high levels (i.e. above 75% penetration) as an additional
‘storage systems cost’ could increase costs (see Section 3.4.2.5 on
Long-term storage).

Different options are possible for whether new investments are permitted
($iv^{\text{new}}$):

  - *If present* is the default option and allows new investments in the
    model if nameplate capacity \> 0. Otherwise, no investment is
    accounted for.

  - *Yes* allows the user to introduced planned investments, that is
    specifying a start year.

  - *No* disables new investments.

  - *Manual* allows the user to enter data. These data will override the
    data determined by the model and new capacity will be accounted for
    as: New Nameplate Investments (MW) = Capacity data entered by the
    user + Planned Retirement.

![](./03/media/image23.png)

Figure 3‑17: Dashboard: Plan or enable new investment

Maximum effective investments, $\text{iv}^{\max},$ are then capped by
non-VRE and VRE limits ($\text{VRE}$):

${\text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\max} = g}_{\text{oc},t}*\zeta_{\text{cft}}*VRE_{\text{cft}}$

Default non-VRE limits are set to 5% for coal and natural gas and 2% for
hydro, oil, other renewables, nuclear and biomass. Default VRE limits
are set to 2% (i.e. for wind and solar).

CPAT allows the user to define non-VRE and VRE scale up rates. The rates
reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE
additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross
additions, not net of retirements). For VRE rates, the following rates
can be selected: Low (1%), Medium (2%), High (3%), Very High (4%),
UserDefined and CountrySpecific (currently set to 2% – except for China
2.5%). The default is country specific.

  - Least-cost merit order

The logit approach and the scale-up limitation determines ‘allocated’
investment. But there is still some needed investment that is not
allocated. We use a least cost merit order approach to determine the
currently ‘unallocated’ investment need.

The least cost algorithm ranks the generation types in terms of the cost
and then use up all their available space (within the capacity limits)
one by one, starting with the cheapest and so on.

First of all, the algorithm defines the **remaining unallocated
investment need**. New effective investment before reallocation are
defined as the minimum between maximum effective investments and new
investments permitted in order to make sure investments cannot be
superior to the maximum capacity. Therefore, this allows to determine
the remaining investments needed, $iv^{\text{rem}}$:

${iv_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{rem}} = \ iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\max} - \min{(\text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\max},\text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{new}})}$

Second, **generation costs are ranked from the cheapest to the most
onerous across technologies** in order to allocate remaining capacity
needed.

Third, remaining capacity are thus **allocated in a second round of
investment** according to the cheapest technology in a cumulative way.

Finally, **total new investments equals investments permitted over the
two rounds of investments**, that is before reallocation and after
reallocation:

$iv^{\text{tot}} = \text{iv}_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{new}} + \ iv_{\text{ocft}}^{\text{rem}}$

##### Calibration and systems costs 

Two calibrations are performed in the engineer power model, that is (1)
a **calibration on the total electricity generation** and (2) an
inferred value for systems cost, **calibrated on the share of coal**.

First, to ensure proper calibration of the engineer power model in 2020,
**a COVID adjustment factor can be used to calibrate total electricity
generation**. The latter, estimated by the model, is compared to
observed data (IEA, 2020). The adjustment factor is calculated as the
percentage difference between the estimated and observed data. Results
per country can be found in the tab ‘CovidAdjust’. For countries not
covered by the IEA database, the factor adjustment is similar to the
Covid adjustment on energy consumption (see Section 3.3.4.4).
Importantly, in 2021, a rebound effect is introduced.

By default, the adjustment factor is set to 0. However, the user can
rely on the adjustment factor by modifying the setting to 1 (see below).
It should be mentioned that the lower and upper limits are set at 25%,
which means that the factor adjustment cannot be less (more) than -25%
(25%).

![](./03/media/image27.png)

Figure 3‑20: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment

Second, **systems costs are currently inferred by using a calibration on
the share of coal in the electricity generation.** This exercise is
carried out using observed data in 2019 based on observed data from the
IEA and consists of matching observed data for the coal share in the
electricity generation. Systerms costs are equivalent to an additional
implicit price for coal, $\text{im}p_{c,\text{coa},t}$. Inferred value
for system costs are thus used for the years after 2019, with the
exception of the year 2020. The latter is considered as exceptional
because of the Covid shock. Therefore, the exercise is repeated for this
year, as systems costs could be higher. IEA’s forecasts on the share of
coal in total electricity generation for the year 2030 are also reported
for information only.

![](./03/media/image28.png)

Figure 3‑21: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment

For the years 2019 and 2020, the following steps are taken:

  - The share of coal in total electricity generation is calculated for
    both the power model’s estimates and observed data from the IEA.
  - To account for the difference between these two values, the “goal
    seek difference” is expressed as the following distance between
    estimated and observed coal share:
    $\left( \text{co}a_{t}^{\text{est}} - \text{co}a_{t}^{\text{obs}} \right)^{2}$,
    where $\text{coa}l_{t}^{\text{est}}$ denotes the share of coal
    estimated by the power model and $\text{coa}l_{t}^{\text{obs}}$
    represents the observed share of coal for
    $t \in \left\{ 2019,2020 \right\}$.
  - As estimated coal share is often over-estimated compared to observed
    data, the goal seek difference is thus addressed by increasing
    prices for coal (i.e. an implicit price component) in order to
    reduce the difference between estimated and observed coal share.
    Only positive implicit price components are considered.

Results of additional implicit prices are reported in the tab
‘GoalSeekCoal’ for both 2019 and 2020. By default, CPAT uses the
additional implicit prices. However, an option in the dashboard allows
the user to turn this assumption off or to manually add the implicit
price component.

![Figure 73: Dashboard: Coal share calibration](./03/media/image29.png)

Figure 3‑22: Dashboard: Coal share calibration

If the “Manual” option is selected, the user overrides the implicit
price component with their choice.

![Figure 74: Dashboard: Coal share calibration
(manual)](./03/media/image30.png)

Figure 3‑23: Dashboard: Coal share calibration (manual)

#### Storage decision

CPAT has a simple model of electricity storage. The required storage
consists of two elements, short and long-term. Both long and short-term
storage is related to the proportion of renewable energy (VRE)
generation as a percentage of total electricity generation. VRE includes
wind and solar and other renewables but not hydro and biomass.

Because the model does not represent renewable energy generation
profiles, relative quantification of balancing capabilities, or
variability in demand, a “system integration cost” is imposed on higher
shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). This cost is assumed to be an
increasing function of VRE share. This additional cost forms part of the
investment decision. The cost of integrating renewables is particularly
significant at high levels (i.e. \>50% by generation) of renewable
penetration into an electricity mix. Against this background, two
different types of storage are considered in the model:

  - Short-term storage, which are costly per kWh but cheap per kW
    (e.g. batteries measured in kWh).
  - Long-term storage, which are costly per kW but cheap per kWh
    (e.g. electrolysis and hydrogen tanks measured in kW).

For both types of storage there is an additional ‘hours’ ratio,
measuring the ratio of battery capacity (kwh) to battery interface (kw),
and electrolysers (kw) to hydrogen storage (kwh). Each storage aspect is
two-dimensional, meaning that every storage technology is determined by
an ‘interface’ (kW) and a ‘storage quantity’ (kWh). The model measures
storage according to one ‘numeraire’ and one ratio. For short-term
storage, we measure the kWh and assume a standard 4-hour ratio between
the kWh and kW in determining the costs. We calculate the kW for
long-term storage and assume 1000 hours of storage per kW.

##### Short-term storage

Short-term storage in CPAT is satisfied by the batteries. Total storage
needs are calculated in hours, which means kWh of storage per kW of
average generation (not peak capacity).

The model uses rounded versions of a parameterization derived from
global data[^3_27]. The model assumes that the total number of storage
for a 100% VRE system is 9 hours, with a quadratic form. We fit the
short-term storage needed (in hours) as a (conservative) quadratic
function of the VRE. We allocate some percentage of this (currently
100%) to the costs of the power system itself. VRE, $v$, includes
solar and wind but not hydro (other renewables are neglected).
Short-term storage $\text{sst}$ is measured in hours,
i.e. kWh/(kWh/h). We also assume a ratio between the kWh of the storage
and the kw interface. For conservatism (given our metric is in kWh), we
use a low number (2 hours) for the ratio of kWh to kw:

$\text{sst} = 9v^{2}$

By way of example, for a 50% VRE system, the hours needed are
$9*{0.5}^{2} = 2.25$ hours.

Therefore, the marginal storage needed is:

$\frac{\text{dsst}}{\text{dv}} = 18v^{2}$

The system has assumed to already have invested optimally in the
existing storage at current VRE.

##### Long-term storage

CPAT also has a long-term storage model. Long-term storage is additional
to short-term storage and is measured according to the cost of the
interface (i.e., the electrolyzers rather than the cost of the storage
tank). The interface is measured in units of KW. Therefore the
proportion of long-term storage per kW of average generation is measured
in dimensionless terms (kW per kW or %).

Long term storage $\text{slt}$ costs are treated as effectively
punitively costly (in contrast to short term storage), reflecting
current costs and technological uncertainties. The long-term storage
model assumes zero need for long-term storage below a VRE penetration of
75 percent, raising to 100 percent at a VRE of 100 percent. To this end,
long-term storage is viewed as additional to short-term storage, and is
needed for VRE over 75%.

Since batteries and hydrogen have other uses, we also have a parameter
that determines the proportion of the short-term and long-term storage
allocated to the electricity system. This is set to 100% for short-term
storage and 33% for long-term storage. This parameter can be modified in
the dashboard:

![](./03/media/image31.png)

Figure 3‑24: Dashboard: Percent allocation of LT storage costs to VRE

Given its interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on
the costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus
assumed as a long-term storage and is measured with the interface
(i.e. electrolysers) as the numeraire. It is given by the following
quadratic function:

$\text{slt} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
0 & \text{for\ }v \leq 0.75 \\
\left( \frac{v - 0.75}{1 - 0.75} \right)^{2} & \text{for\ }v > 0.75 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Long term storage requirements are measured in MW/MW, i.e. dimensionless
units (%). The marginal MW of electrolysers required once VRE
penetration reaches 75% is thus varying according to the derivative
$2*\frac{v - 0.75}{\left( 1 - 0.75 \right)^{2}}$. The table below
shows the results for different levels of VRE.

##### Levelized cost of storage

The levelized cost of the marginal quantity of storage needed to
maintain required quantities of total storage is added to the investment
costs for VRE. This means that the storage-inclusive cost of renewables
can rise in time as renewable penetrations increase, even if the cost of
renewables without storage is falling.

### Elasticity model

#### Overview

The elasticity-based model is derived from an IMF spreadsheet tool, with
a methodology described in an IMF board paper[^3_28]. The CPAT mitigation
module, and the IMF tool on which it is based, are primarily
elasticity-based models, meaning that future fuel demand is dependent on
projected total real GDP growth, and upon future energy prices, modified
by mitigation policies such as carbon taxes. The power supply model is
also based on elasticities, although it has a more complex structure
than in other sectors. It separately models final power demand, and
within that overall power demand the generation share of different
generation types.

#### Notation

The table below presents the notations used in the section and the name
of the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are
reported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made
to ensure that they match our calculations.

#### Generation costs

Importantly, by default, the power generation costs are taken from the
engineer model (i.e. levelized fixed cost plus current variable costs,
but excluding intangible coal cost). However, this assumption can be
modified and the cost model from the IMF board paper can, if wished, be
selected in the dashboard. The methodology for these ‘old’ costs is
given the IMF paper mentioned above.

![Figure 49: Dashboard: Use Spot Fuel Prices in Engineer Power
Model](./03/media/image32.png)

Figure 3‑25: Dashboard: Use old or new generation costs in elasticity
model

Renewable producer subsidies under a baseline scenario, as well as under
the policy scenario, can be specified in the dashboard:

![](./03/media/image33.png)

Figure 3‑26: Dashboard: Renewable producer subsidies under a baseline
scenario

#### Total power demand

As described above, power demand is determined by the energy use
equation. As this is a total power demand, elasticities are averaged
across all sectors. The autonomous efficiency improvements (or more
especially, the annual generation productivity improvements) used across
fuels are as follows:

| Fuels            | Change |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Coal             | 0.5%   |
| Natural gas      | 1.0%   |
| Oil              | 0.5%   |
| Nuclear          | 1.0%   |
| Wind             | 5.0%   |
| Solar            | 5.0%   |
| Hydro            | 1.0%   |
| Other renewables | 5.0%   |
| Biomass          | 1.0%   |

Productivity improvements at power plants reflect improvements in
technical efficiency and gradual retirement of older, less efficient
plants. Following the IMF Board Paper, for coal, annual average
productivity growth is taken to be 0.5 percent based on IEA’s data. For
natural gas, nuclear, and hydro, there is likely a bit more room for
productivity improvements and baseline annual growth rate of 1 percent
is assumed. For renewables, a productivity growth rate of 5 percent is
used (i.e., costs halve every 15 years).

For the base year, energy consumption is extracted from energy balances,
expressed as total energy consumption net of fuel transformation and
transportation. The index $E$ denotes the sector Electricity.

For 2020, estimates are based on the previous year’s data adjusted for a
one-time exogenous shock, i.e., Covid (see Section 3.3.4.4).

$\frac{E_{\text{oct}}}{E_{\text{oc},t - 1}} = \left( 1 + \alpha \right)^{- \left( 1 + \epsilon_{U} \right)}\left( 1 + 0.5*\Psi_{\text{ct}} \right)\left( \frac{p_{\text{cEt}}}{p_{\text{cE},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{U,\text{cE}}}\left( \frac{p_{\text{cEt}}}{p_{\text{cE},t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{F,\text{cE}}}\left( \frac{Y_{\text{ct}}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{G,\text{cE}}}$

In the elasticity model, half the usual Covid adjustment is employed as
power demand does not fall as far as other energy types.

#### Total power supply

Power generation fuels potentially include coal, natural gas, oil,
nuclear, hydro, biomass wind, solar and other renewables.

Similar to the engineer model, total demand is scaled to generation
(which includes additionally transmission losses, energy industry own
use and transmission losses). The total production of electricity,
$g_{\text{oct}}$, is driven by the total power demand multiplied by
the ratio of generation to demand in the base year.

$g_{\text{oct}} = E_{\text{oct}}*\frac{g_{\text{oc},t_{0}}}{E_{\text{oc},t_{0}}}$

For the base year, total electricity generation is based on observed
energy balance data, which is the sum of all electricity generation from
each fuel $f$.

The elasticity model provides two types of information when it comes to
forecast generation of each type of fuel: the electricity output and the
primary energy used for electricity production for each technology.

**The electricity output** from technology $f$ is defined as the
production share multiplied the total production. The production share,
$\Phi_{\text{ocft}}$ is derived from observed data and is defined as
the ratio between the observed electricity output from fuel $f$ and
the total production, that is
$\frac{g_{\text{ocft}}}{g_{\text{oct}}}$. The production share is
assumed to be fixed until 2020. After this date, to accommodate flexible
assumptions for the degree of substitution among fuels, the share of
fuel $f$ in generation is defined as:

$\Phi_{\text{ocft}} = \Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\left( \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \right)^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}} + \frac{\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\sum_{i \neq f}^{}\left\lbrack 1 - \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocit}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{oci},t - 1}^{*}} \right\rbrack^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}}}{\sum_{j \neq f}^{}\Phi_{\text{ocj},t - 1}}$

where $i$ and $j$ are bound variables ranging over the same range as
$f$ (i.e., OIL, NGA, COA, NUC, WND, SOL, BIO, REN, HYD). In addition,
$\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}$ denotes the total unit cost adjusted of
thermal efficiency and $\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}} < 0$ is the
conditional own-price elasticity of generation from fuel $f$ with
respect to generation cost. Conditional (indicated by $\\tilde$) here
means the elasticity reflects the percent reduction in use of fuel $f$
due to switching from that fuel to other generation fuels, per
one-percent increase in generation cost for fuel $f$, holding total
electricity generation fixed. Generation cost elasticities are larger
than corresponding fuel price elasticities as an incremental increase in
fuel and non-fuel generation costs has a bigger impact than an
incremental increase in fuel costs alone.

From the above equation, fuel $f$’s generation share decreases in own
generation cost. It also increases in the generation cost of fuel
$i \neq f$, where the increase in fuel $f$’s generation share is the
reduced share fuel $i$ (i.e., $\Phi_{\text{ocft}}$ times the term in
square brackets) multiplied by the (initial) share of fuel $f$ in
generation from all fuel alternatives to $i$ (i.e.,
$\frac{\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}}{\sum_{f \neq i}^{}\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}}$:

NB: The actual equation in CPAT also reflects that nuclear and hydro
should normally not grow beyond current levels. Therefore the model
reallocates any excess growth for nuclear and hydro to other generation
types. The equation above thus becomes:

$\Phi_{\text{ocft}} = \Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\left( \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \right)^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}} + \frac{\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}\sum_{f \neq i}^{}\left\lbrack 1 - \iota_{\text{cft}} \right\rbrack^{\epsilon_{\widetilde{E}}}}{\sum_{f \neq i}^{}\Phi_{\text{ocf},t - 1}}*\delta^{\text{add}}$

where
$\iota_{\text{cft}} = \frac{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\text{gn}c_{\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}}$
and
$\delta_{\text{oct}}^{\text{add}} = \frac{\text{TotExces}s_{\text{oc},\text{NUC} + \text{HYD},t}}{\left( 1 - \Phi_{\text{oc},\text{HYD},t} - \Phi_{\text{oc},\text{NUC},t} \right)}$

**The energy used of each technology** $f$ **in electricity
production**

Similarly, to electricity output, the base year corresponds to observed
data, with the exception of wind, hydropower, solar and other renewables
which are equal to electricity output. Therefore, for the following
years, the energy used in electricity production is expressed as
follows:

$F_{\text{ocft}} = E_{\text{ocft}}*\left( \frac{1}{1 + \alpha_{f}} \right)^{t}\frac{F_{\text{ocf},0}}{E_{\text{ocf},0}}$

The fuel use is equal to the electricity generated multiplied by an
efficiency improvement over time $\alpha_{f}$ specific to the
generation type $f$.

###  Power data sources and parameter choices


#### Overview

##### Sources

The section presents the data sources and the methodology to estimate
the different characteristics of the power sector. In particular, is it
first important to present the data and explain how consistency is
ensured across the different data sources. The remainder of the section
focuses on the methodology employed to estimate the power sector
characteristics.

In the mitigation module, and in particular in the power sector, CPAT
relies on several characteristics presented in the section below, along
with their definition.

The table below presents the different data sources used to estimate
power plant characteristics.

Table 3‑7: Power characteristics and data sources

![Figure 51: Data mapping and description of data
sources](./03/media/image34.png)

As presented above, CPAT relies on various data sources which provide
project-based data, that is:

  - IRENA (IRENA, 2020): The IRENA Renewable Cost Database contains cost
    and performance data for around 17 000 renewable power generation
    projects across the world with a total capacity of more than 1,770
    GW.
  - IEA\&NEA (IEA\&NEA, 2020): The database covers 243 plants in 24
    countries.
  - EIA (EIA, 2021): Data were collected on the status of existing
    electric generating plants and projects scheduled for initial
    commercial operation within 5 or 10 years in the United States and
    Puerto Rico.
  - Enerdata: The tool provides data power generation assets in around
    150 countries throughout the world based on 7800 operating projects
    or projects under development.
  - JRC (Ioannis Tsiropoulos et al., 2018): Based on confidential,
    project-based European data from 2015, the authors provide forecast
    estimates of investment costs.
  - Breyer (Bogdanov et al., 2019): This study bases its global
    estimations on various above-mentioned sources. In particular, the
    authors rely mainly on IEA\&NEA for renewable data and BNEF for
    non-renewable data to forecast some characteristics. The authors
    provide data for the years 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045
    and 2050.
  - NREL: Cole et al. (2021) and Augustine & Blair (2021) provide
    historical as well as forecast data for utility-scale battery
    storage costs in the United-States. The former article’s data and
    estimates are based on a survey of 18 studies, including sources
    mentioned above. Cole et al. (2021) update their work on a yearly
    basis. Cole et al. (2021) is the latest update. The latter study
    based their projection costs on BNEF data, which provide learning
    rates and deployment projections for utility-scale battery. Another
    advantage of relying on BNEF data lies in the provision of data on
    component of batteries.

##### Data approach for the power prices and ‘Engineer’ power model

The power models have important data requirements. There are two main
types of data sources: first (method one), we have components that are
directly from, or derived from, energy consumption data and energy
capacity data; second (method two), we have components that come from
studies.

Two crucial quantities use a combination of data sources: thermal
efficiency and capacity factor.

**Method 1: Energy Consumption, capacity data, and derived data**

There are three primary energy consumption datasets used: electricity
generation (in GWh), by generation type, fuel use (in ktoe), and
electrical capacity (in MW). Before beginning, all three energy sources
are converted to a consistent unit, MW, equivalent to MWy per year.

Thermal efficiency is calculated thus:

$\nu_{\text{cf}} = \frac{g_{\text{cf},t_{0}}}{F_{\text{cEf},t_{0}}}$

For coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, and biomass, where
$F_{\text{ocEf},t_{0}}$ is the fuel f used for the generation of
electricity $g_{\text{ocf},t_{0}}$[^3_29]$,$ in the base year,
baseline scenario. For solar, wind, hydro, and other renewables,
efficiency is set by convention to 1. As mentioned before, we use Net
Calorific Values exclusively.

If efficiency is less than a certain level, currently set to be 10%, we
use the best data from studies rather than derived efficiencies. Note
the efficiencies are not ‘floored’ in this case but instead set to be
equal to the study data.

Capacity data are taken from EIA, except for fossil fuel types which are
taken from the EIA all-fossil average and then descaled using estimated
proportions calculated by CPAT from other sources.

Capacity factors are derived in a similar way

$cf_{\text{cf}} = \frac{g_{\text{cf},t_{0}}}{\text{ca}p_{\text{cf},t_{0}}}$

These data are used in CPAT unless they are outside specific ranges set
in the dashboard.

**Method 2: Components derived from studies**

To compute cost, specific disaggregated prices and other components
(e.g., lifetime) data by technology and sometimes by country are used.
Input data are derived as averages of EIA, IEA & NEA, IRENA, JRC (EU),
Bodganov, et al., and NREL data.

These averages are made by country, region and world, with selected
study data chosen by country, region then world according to data
availability. Note that the asia region does not include China, Japan
and (South) Korea, because of widely different costs compared to the
regional average.

#### Description and definition of the variables

Capital costs are overnight, that is excluding interest payments during
the construction time. **Overnight cost** designates the cost of a
construction project if no interest rates are incurred during the
construction time.

In the power sector, **thermal efficiency (or heat rate)** expresses the
fraction of heat that becomes useful work. In other words, the amount of
energy input that is transformed into work output can be computed
through the thermal efficiency: $\varphi = \frac{W}{Q_{I}}$. Thermal
efficiency is comprised between 0 and 100%. For instance, if 200 joules
of thermal energy are input ($Q_{I}$), and the engine transforms this
energy into 80 joules, the efficiency rate is 40%. In the United-States,
the heat rate is widely spread and is expressed in British Thermal Units
(BTU). One BTU is equivalent to roughly 1055 joules and 2.93E-4 kWh.

![](./03/media/image35.png)

Figure 3‑27: Data mapping and description of data sources

There are two ways of calculating thermal efficiency, that is in **net
or gross calorific value**. Calorific value is an essential parameter to
specify the energetic content of different materials. **Net calorific
value (or low heating value)** subtracts the heat of vaporization of the
water from the gross calorific value, while the **gross calorific value
(or high heating value)** is the total amount of heat produced from the
complete combustion of a unit of a substance. It is essential to verify
whether the efficiency is net or gross because the difference can be
about 5% to 6% of the gross value for solid and liquid fuels, and about
10% for natural gas.

For instance, in a gas power plant, let’s say that to produce 1kWh of
electricity, 3kWh of natural gas in gross calorific value (GCV) is
necessary. The net calorific value (NCV) can be derived from the gross
calorific value by using a factor of 0.9 (Eurostat et al., 2004).
Consequently, in NCV, 2.7kWh are necessary to produce 1kWh. The thermal
efficiency is therefore equivalent to $\frac{1}{3} = 33\%$ in GCV and
$\frac{1}{2.7} = 37\%$ in NCV or, equivalently, the thermal efficiency
in GVC corresponds to the thermal efficiency in NVC to which the
conversion rate is applied: $37\% \times 0.9 = 33\%$. The conversion
rate fluctuates with the fuel used but also the technology used.
Finally, the heat rate is often expressed in British thermal units (BTU)
per net kWh generated. To express the efficiency of a generator or power
plant as a percentage, it is essential to divide the equivalent BTU
content of a kWh of electricity (3,412 BTU) by the heat rate.

The **capacity factor** measures the frequency of operation of a power
plant during a given period. It is expressed as a percentage and is
calculated by dividing the unit’s actual power output by the maximum
possible output. This ratio indicates how much of a unit’s capacity is
being used.

#### Consistency across data sources

The simple average of the data sources is used to construct our dataset
of electricity sector characteristics. Nevertheless, faced with
different approaches, we first analyze the underlying assumptions of
each data source and performed a few adjustments to build a consistent
approach. The table below outlines the different assumptions underlying
the construction of variables in the power sector according to various
data sources and correction is CPAT. Green cells indicates that no
adjustments have been made, whereas orange cells provide adjustments
made in CPAT. As the study of Bogdanov et al. (2019) is based on the
data sources listed in the table, it is not incorporated in the table.

Table 3‑8: Assumption underlying the construction of power data

![Figure 53: Assumption underlying the construction of power
data](./03/media/image36.png)

As the various data sources rely on disparate assumptions under a few
aspects, adjustments are made to build a consistent database to be fed
into CPAT. As such, the following adjustments are performed.

**Costs in time**: The latest version of CPAT relies on data in 2019. As
costs in time may vary depending on status of the power plant
(e.g. operational, under construction, authorized, etc.), the retained
approach first aims at building time series based on the available data
points in time across the different data sources. Longest time series
span from 1983 to 2040. While all sources focus on operational power
plants or in the pipeline for commissioning after 2019, Enerdata
considers a multitude of statuses, including cancelled or announced
projects. Therefore, we filter the status of the plants and select only
plants that are operational until 2020. From 2021 to 2040, only
announced and authorized projects, power plants under construction and
PPA signed are considered in the construction of time series. In the
case of Bogdanov et al. (2019), which provide data every five years
(i.e. starting from 2015), estimates for the year 2019 are approximated
using the following weighting approach:
$\text{CAPE}X_{2019} = 0.2 \times \text{CAPE}X_{2015} + 0.8 \times \text{CAPE}X_{2020}$.

**Overnight costs**: Capital costs are in principle excluding interest
payments during construction time. However, IRENA Renewable Cost
database provides total installed costs, namely including overnight
costs. To adjust data from overnight costs, two information are needed:

  - The construction time ($n_{\text{cons}}$) data for each renewable
    technology. This information is derived from both EIA and IEA\&NEA.
    The average of the two sources of information is used as in the
    table below.
  - The weighted average cost of capital (*wacc*). Following Steffen
    (2020), the WACC is roughly 7.5% for OECD countries and 10% for
    non-OECD countries. We thus apply the following rates:

  - Finally, the following formula is used to subtract overnight costs:
    $\frac{\text{CapE}x_{\text{IRENA}}}{\left( 1 + \text{wacc} \right)_{\text{cons}}^{n}}$.

**Costs are in USD and real (i.e. net of inflation)**: Only BNEF
database displays nominal data. Monetary data are thus adjusted based on
the US GDP deflator indicator. In the case of JRC and Breyer, data are
real but denominated in EUR. The 2019 average EUR/US exchange rate is
applied.

**Efficiency in Net Calorific Value**: The differences between net and
gross calorific values are typically about 5% to 6% of the gross value
for solid and liquid fuels, and about 10% for natural gas. Therefore,
based on the original (GCV) data from BNEF, we approximate the NCV by
applying a 10% increase for natural gas and 5.5% for the other
technologies considered on the GCV values.

**Lifetime assumptions**: Lifetime information is given for all types of
technologies considered in CPAT except for biomass. A lifetime of 35
years for power plants specialized in biomass is supposed.

#### Estimation of the power sector characteristics

To estimate power sector characteristics in 2019, simple averages of
available data points are computed. In the first stage, in order not to
overweight one data source over another, the averages are calculated by
data source, as a data source may provide different data at a given time
and for the same technology because data are project-based. In a second
step, the calculation of averages is deployed in the following order of
priority: by country, by CPAT region[^3_30], and globally. More
specifically, to construct a dataset for the year 2019:

  - CapEx is estimated based on 2019 data points only; 2019 is retained
    as a commissioning year for power plants.
  - For Fixed and Variable OpEx, Efficiency and Capacity Factor, due to
    data limitation, closest trends are included (i.e. the average
    includes estimates for plants commissioning between 2015 and 2025).
    This approach is reasonable because these variables do not vary
    greatly from year to year.

**Forecasting CAPEX**: In the case of wind and solar, we use the
learning curve method to forecast global CAPEX from 2023 to 2050. The
underlying idea is to highlight the cross-country transferability of a
country's learning effects. For wind and solar only, we use capacity
projections from the IEA Stated Policy (STEPS)[^3_31] and Net Zero
(NZE)[^3_32] scenarios, then experience Parameters extracted from Way et
al., 2022[^3_33].

We set the values of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 of wind and solar global
CAPEX equal to the 2019 values.

Following the work of JRC (see Tsiropoulos et al., 2018), the learning
curve method to forecast CAPEX for renewable energies different of wind
and solar from 2023 to 2040[^3_34] is applied to each CPAT region, China,
Japan, Korea[^3_35] and worldwide. The other technologies, i.e. coal,
oil, natural gas, and nuclear, are not subject to a learning rate nor to
different scenarios and are assumed to be constant over time.

The learning rate method is commonly employed to estimate development of
costs over time and holds the advantage of being relatively easy to
measure. With specific learning rate to technologies, this approach
indicates the price reduction of the considered technology (i.e. the
performance indicator) arising from every doubling of cumulative
installed capacity (experience rate). Experience does not cause costs to
drop directly. While it is believed to be correlated to changes in the
production process (e.g. R\&D, technical innovation, economies of scale
or labor productivity) or the product itself (e.g. design), the model
does not identify the factor of cost reduction. More sophisticated
models such as the component-based learning cost, multi-factor learning
curve (Rubin et al., 2015) or approach based on probabilistic cost
forecasting methods (Way et al., 2021).

Cost reduction in time, accounting for the performance and experience
indicators, is expressed by:

$\text{Cos}t_{t} = \text{Cos}t_{0}\left( \frac{\text{Ca}p_{t}}{\text{Ca}p_{0}} \right)^{\left( - \varepsilon \right)}$

where $\text{Cos}t_{t}$ is the unit cost of the considered technology
in year $t$ after the deployment of cumulative installed capacity of
$\text{Ca}p_{t}$ unit. Similarly, $\text{Cos}t_{0}$ stands for CapEx
in year 0 at cumulative deployment capacity of $\text{Ca}p_{0}$ unit.
$\varepsilon$ denotes the experience parameter. The learning rate
($\text{LR}$) is thus:

$\text{LR} = 1 - 2^{\varepsilon}$

where the parameter $2^{\varepsilon}$ is known as the learning rate
ratio or progress ratio and reflects the slope of the learning curve.

In the case of wind and solar, we consider four different
scenarios[^3_36]:

  - The **low scenario**: we use the IEA STEPS scenario for capacity
    projections data, and a low learning rate parameter (equal to mean –
    standard deviation ; 0.276 for Solar, 0.153 for Wind)

  - The **medium scenario**: we use the IEA STEPS scenario for capacity
    projections data, and a medium learning rate parameter (0.319 for
    Solar, 0.194 for Wind)

  - The **high scenario**: we use the IEA NZE scenario for capacity
    projections data, and a medium learning rate parameter (0.319 for
    Solar, 0.194 for Wind)

  - The **very high scenario**: we use the IEA NZE scenario for capacity
    projections data, and a high learning rate parameter (equal to mean
    + standard deviation ; 0.362 for Solar, 0.235 for Wind)

Similarly, to JRC for renewables other than wind and solar, the approach
taken is built around three scenarios:

  - The **low scenario** is associated with a 0.5% increase of the
    installed capacity. A low scenario covers a low renewable supply
    energy deployment and reflects a baseline scenario;

  - The **medium scenario** is associated with a 1% increase of the
    installed capacity and corresponds to a mid-range deployment of
    renewable energy supply;

  - The **high scenario** is associated with a 2.5% increase of the
    installed capacity and mirrors high ambitious in terms of additional
    capacity installed of renewable energy supply; and

  - The **very high scenario** is associated with a 4% increase of the
    installed capacity. Such an increase reflects an ambitious uptake of
    renewable energy supply accompanied by ambitious policies.

The learning rates employed is from JRC, as well as from authors’ own
assumptions (in particular for the high/very high scenario) and are
described in the below table for both technologies and for all
scenarios. The learning rate does not vary across time.

The first equation is then applied for the different scenarios and
technologies described in the table above with $\text{Cos}t_{0}$ and
$\text{Ca}p_{0}$ being CapEx and installed capacity for the year 2022,
respectively, and $\text{Ca}p_{t}$ standing for the forecast installed
capacity for the year the CapEx is estimated ($\text{Cos}t_{t}$).

Finally, renewable technologies are more metals and minerals than
non-renewables[^3_37] hence rising metals/minerals costs can be expected
to increase the relative cost of new renewables investment. Considering
the surge in international metals and mineral prices in 2021-2,
projected capital expenditure costs for investment in new renewable and
non-renewable capacity were therefore upscaled. Metals and all other
commodities are expected to increase by about 2 times in 2022-3[^3_38]
compared to 2020 levels and assuming that these primary inputs into
renewables account for roughly one tenth of the total of renewables
up-front investment costs, which are themselves about 75% of total costs
for renewables,[^3_39] the increase of CapEx for renewables would be
about 15% in 2022-3 compared to 2020. However, as a part of this
increase might be captured in 2020-1 data, the CapEx increase in new
renewable and non-renewable capacity was upscaled by 10% and 5% in 2022
respectively, declining to a 5% and 2.5% permanent increase in 2030
compared with previous projections.

**Storage costs**: Utility-scale battery storage systems differ slightly
from other technologies as they store produced electricity by generators
or pulled from the electric grid. These systems then redistribute the
power based on the demands. It is worth noting that battery storage
costs are commonly expressed in kWh, although one fraction of these
costs, the power costs, are measured in kW. We follow Feldman et
al. (2020) and express the costs of battery as follows:
$\text{TotalCost}\left( \frac{\text{USD}}{\text{kWh}} \right) = \text{EnergyCost}\left( \frac{\text{USD}}{\text{kWh}} \right) + \text{PowerCost}\left( \frac{\text{USD}}{\text{kW}} \right)/(\text{Duration}\left( \text{hr} \right)$

Several types of battery exist, typically varying from 1h to 4h storage
battery. In CPAT, costs for battery correspond to 2h storage battery.
Forecast storage costs are based on the work of Cole et al. (2021) and
Augustine & Blair (2021)[^3_40]. The authors base their estimations on
current literature and data for Li-Ion Battery Storage, 60 MW, 240 MWh
storage (4 hours) in the United-States are used as representative data.
Costs for 2h storage battery are then estimated based on the above
formula and expressed in kW[^3_41]. In particular, all values are given
in 2019 U.S. dollars, using the Consumer Price Index (BLS, 2020) for
dollar year conversions. Projections use an inflation assumption of 2.5%
per year. In the same vein as for wind and solar, three scenarios are
developed. The low, middle and high scenarios correspond to the minimum,
median and maximum points, respectively. Augustine & Blair (2021)
follows the approach in Cole et al. (2021), where data points between
2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050 are derived from a linear interpolation.

**Decommissioning costs**: Decommissioning takes place after a power
plant retires. Notably, retirement and decommissioning are different.
Retirement indicates that the plant is no longer producing electricity,
but assets such as buildings, turbines, boilers or other equipment are
left on site. The decommissioning process refers to dismantlement,
environmental remediation and restoration of the site. While much of the
literature focuses on decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants,
data on decommissioning costs for other types of technology are scant.
The following data sources are used in CPAT:

  - Raimi (2017) provides estimates on decommissioning costs per type of
    technologies (offshore and onshore wind, coal, concentrated solar,
    solar PV and petroleum and gas) based on a survey of the literature.
    Data are expressed at 2016 U.S. dollar prices;
  - OECD\&NEA (2016) presents data on nuclear power plant
    decommissioning costs based on surveys answered by nuclear power
    plants located in Europe. Data are expressed at 2013 U.S. dollar
    prices;
  - Duke Energy Corporation[^3_42] is a nuclear power plant that
    submitted information to the US authority on the cost of
    decommissioning. Data are expressed at 2017 U.S. dollar prices; and
  - Water Power & Dam construction[^3_43] estimates, based on information
    on dam destruction in the United-States, that decommissioning costs
    can be 20-40% of new construction costs.

In CPAT, decommissioning costs are expressed as a percentage of global
upfront costs. To this purpose, for nuclear, estimates retrieved from
these studies are averaged. The ratio of the available data for
decommissioning costs to the global CapEx (US/MW) data by technology
type, are then used to express decommissioning costs as a percentage of
CapEx. For natural gas, the average between estimated decommissioning
costs for petroleum and gas (various types) is used as decommissioning
costs. For hydropower, based on the above-mentioned study, it is assumed
that decommissioning costs amount to 20% of CapEx.

## Emissions

This section describes how GHG emissions estimation and emissions are
accounted for in CPAT and how they are projected in each sector.

### Overview

In CPAT, emissions are projected in two ways: i) energy-related
emissions are based on a model, that is estimations of energy
consumption (see Section 3.3) in the different sectors are converted
into GHG emissions by the means of an emission factor; and ii)
non-energy related emissions are forecasted based on particular
assumptions. The table below summarizes the approach taken to forecast
emissions forward.

Emissions have **two dimensions**:

  - **Pollutants**: Carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$), Methane ($CH_{4}$),
    Nitrous oxide ($N_{2}O$) and Fluorinated gases (F-gases). GHG
    emissions include those in the UNFCCC inventories ($CO_{2}$,
    $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$ and Fluorinated Gases (or F-gases), including
    PFCs, HFCs SF<sub>6,</sub> and NF<sub>3</sub>). Note that the
    mitigation also presents short-lived air pollutants
    (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NOx, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NMVOC, BC,
    OC, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO); the methodology for these is covered in
    the air pollution module documentation.
  - 
  - **Sectors**: Energy-related sectors (i.e., Transport, Power,
    Industry, Building, and Other energy use), as well as
    non-energy-related sectors (i.e., Agriculture, Industrial Process,
    LULUCF, Waste and Other). It is important to note that some parts of
    the sectors accounted for in the non-energy sectors are also
    reflected in energy-related sectors. For instance, Agriculture also
    appears under the ‘Building’ sector, under ‘Food and Forestry’
    sub-sector (for more information, see Appendix B). 

CPAT considers territorial rather than consumption-based emissions. This
means that, for example, if some natural gas is imported but subject to
leaks upstream in extraction before it arrives at the country concerned,
these methane emissions are not counted in the emissions of a natural
gas power station. However, an extracting country will include those
leaks. Similarly, the emissions from imported goods are not included,
whereas those associated with exported goods are included.

In what follows, we first define the role of emission factors and their
sources. Second, we present the approach adopted for energy-related
$_{}$ and non- $_{}$ by fuel and sector. Third, we describe the
estimation of emissions in non-energy sectors. We use the index $p$ to
refer to the type of GHG ($CO_{2}$, $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$ and
F-gases). The variable $em_{\text{ocupt}}$ denotes the estimation of
emissions under scenario $o$, country $c$, UNFCC sector $u$ , and
for pollutant $p$ and at year $t$. Total GHG emissions are the sum
of both energy and non-energy related emissions:
$em_{\text{oc},\text{GHG},t} = em_{\text{ocER},\text{GHG},t} + em_{\text{ocNER},\text{GHG},t}$.
Finally, the section explains how NDCs are accounted for in CPAT.

### Notation

The table below presents the notations used in the section and the name
of the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are
reported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made
to ensure that they match our calculations.

### Emission factors

An emission factor is a coefficient that converts activity data into GHG
emissions. It represents the average emission rate for a given fuel
relative to consumption units. For instance, in the power sector, coal
emits 3.931 ton of $_{}$ per ktoe.

The emission factors used are (as a default) fuel-, country- and
sector-specific emissions from IIASA’s GAINS model[^3_44]. The user also
has the option to use global emissions factors from the IEA.[^3_45] The
emission factors given by the IEA are scaled at a worldwide level, while
those from IIASA are country specific. Also, IIASA emission factors
include process and fugitive emissions in the distribution network from
natural gas (which is why it is necessary to rescale them through the
overall calibration to 2019 emissions). All emission factors are sector
and fuel specific.

The user has the possibility in the dashboard to select the source of
emission factors to be used. Global IEA emissions factors are also an
option.

![Figure 63: Selection of the source of emission
factors](./03/media/image37.png)

Figure 3‑28: Selection of the source of emission factors

The emissions are given originally in
$\frac{\text{tC}O_{2}}{\text{GJ}}$, then converted in
$\frac{\text{tC}O_{2}}{\text{ktoe}}$ via a $\text{ktoe}$ to
$\text{GJ}$ conversion factor of $41,868$.

$ef_{\text{cgf},\frac{\text{tC}O_{2}}{\text{ktoe}}} = ef_{\text{cgf},\frac{\text{tC}O_{2}}{\text{GJ}}}*41,868$

Furthermore, it is worth noting that we do not have data for emission
factors for sector-fuel types when the energy consumption is close to
zero. Therefore, the following rules are applied to define emission
factors when missing:

| Sector-Fuel types                       | Assumptions                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Power sector-LPG                        | Equal to emission factors in the industrial sector |
| Road-LPG                                | Equal to emission factors in the building sector   |
| Power sector-Kerosene and Road-Kerosene | Equal to emission factors in the building sector   |
| Road-Coal                               | Equal to emission factors in the power sector      |
| Road-Other oil products                 | Equal to emission factors for diesel               |
| All sectors-Biomass                     | Emission factors are equal to zero                 |

### Energy-related emissions

Energy-related emissions are estimated across sectors and by aggregating
sectors (i.e., Transport, Power, Industry, Building, and Other energy
uses) for the four GHGs (i.e. $\text{CO}_{2}$, $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$
and F-gases). In this section, the index $u = E$, denotes the
energy-related sectors.

#### Carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$) and methane ($CH_{4}$)

Energy-related $CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ emissions are calculated by
multiplying energy consumption by emissions factors. Emissions are
multiplied by $10^{- 6}$ as the emission factor $\text{ef}$ is given
in tCO2e/ktoe and the fossil fuel consumption $F$ is given in ktoe, to
obtain emissions in mtCO2e. We neglect this unit transformation in the
description below.

In 2019, these emissions (both $CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ energy-related
emissions) are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions, meaning they are
multiplied by a factor such that base-year emissions are equal in the
model and the inventory. In other words, the model is adjusting $_{}$
and $_{}$ emissions to match the model and inventory. This scaling
factor is close to 1 for $CO_{2}$, but are typically greater than one
for $CH_{4}$. This scaling applies only to the aggregate emissions and
not to the price effect. It only applies to the core modelled emissions
of energy related $CO_{2}$, and $CH_{4}$ and not to any other gas or
any other UNFCCC sector.

After 2019, these emissions are thus calculated, for each fuel $f$ and
for a year $t$, as the multiplication of the fossil fuel’s consumption
for year $t$ by the sector’s associated to emission factor:

$em_{\text{ocEsfpt}} = F_{\text{ocEsft}}*ef_{\text{cEsfp}}$

where $o$ represents scenario, $s$, sector, $f$, fuel type, $p$,
GHG (e.g., $CO_{2}$) and $t$ the year.

$CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ emissions are determined across all fuels and
across all sectors (and grouping sectors). Total energy emissions are
determined as the sum across sectors and fuels (for energy related
emissions u=E)

$em_{\text{ocpt}} = \sum_{s}^{}{\sum_{f}^{}e}m_{\text{ocsfpt}}$

Furthermore, total energy-related $_{}$ **and** $_{}$ emissions are
augmented by energy distribution losses and methane energy-related
emissions are subject to a calibration. In particular:

  - **Total energy-related** $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}$
    **emissions** include energy distribution losses, that is the sum of
    combustion emissions and the fugitive and venting $CO_{2}$
    emissions. The latter are mostly from natural gas pipes plus coal
    mines. These are a part of energy-related $CO_{2}$ emissions but
    they are not combustion.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Total energy-related** $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{4}}$
    **emissions** are calibrated to 2019 shares. The factor is the 2019
    ratio of methane emissions to the sum of the total global warming
    potential[^3_46] from methane emissions $\text{gwp}$ and the
    methane fugitive and venting emissions $\text{fug}$. Then,
    projections are made by multiplying this factor with the sum of the
    $\text{gwp}$ and the $\text{fug}$ for the current year $t$.
    For $t \geq 2019$:

$em_{ocE,CH_{4},t} = \frac{em_{ocE,CH_{4},2019}}{\text{gw}p_{ocE,CH_{4},2019} + \text{fu}g_{ocE,CH_{4},2019}}*\left( \text{gw}p_{ocE,CH_{4},t} + \text{fu}g_{ocE,CH_{4},t} \right)$

CPAT also covers the other parts of the UNFCCC inventories (i.e. GHGs
other than $CO_{2}$ and methane, and other categories than
energy-related GHGs). For these emissions, the UNFCCC inventories are
scaled by various growth rates, detailed in the next section.

#### Nitrous oxide ($N_{2}O$) and Flourinated gases (F-gases)

$N_{2}O$ *and F-gases energy-related emissions estimates follow the
below rules:*

  - **Total energy-related** $\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{O}$
    **emissions** are scaled to $CO_{2}$ emissions. For $t > 2019$:

$em_{oc,N_{2}O,t} = em_{oc,N_{2}O,\left( t - 1 \right)}*\frac{em_{\text{oc},CO_{2},t}}{em_{\text{oc},CO_{2},\left( t - 1 \right)}}$

  - **Total energy-related F-gases emissions** ($p = \text{PF}C_{s}$,
    $\text{HF}C_{s}$, $SF6$, $NF3$) are historically zero for the
    energy category. For $t > 2018$: $em_{\text{ocpt}} = 0$.

### Non-energy related emissions

Non-energy-related emissions are estimated across non-energy-related
sectors (i.e. Agriculture, Industrial Process, LULUCF, Waste, and Other)
for the four GHGs (i.e. $\text{CO}_{2}$, $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$ and
F-gases). Non-energy-related emissions in the different sectors
considered above are determined based on various sector-specific
assumptions. In particular:

  - In the **industrial processes and product use** sector, the growth
    rate is based on changes in energy-related industrial $CO_{2}$
    emissions.

  - Non-energy **agriculture** emissions are forecasted based on the GDP
    and population growths.

  - Forecasted non-energy emissions for **LULUCF** are driven by a sink
    activity growth and the ratio of the growth in emissions for the
    carbon tax scenario to the increase in emissions for the baseline
    scenario. Net sources and net sinks are treated differently (see
    below)

  - For **waste and other** emissions, forecasted estimates are
    determined by population growth.

#### Industrial processes and product use

In the industrial processes and product use sector, the growth rate is
based on changes in energy-related industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions.

In what follows, the index $u = I$, standing for Industrial Processes
and Product Use.

Non-energy-related industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions are forecasted based
on an industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions rate
($\text{Δe}m_{ocP,CO_{2},t + 1}$). Therefore:

$\text{Δe}m_{ocI,CO_{2},t + 1} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\max\left( 0;\frac{em_{\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t + 1}}{em_{\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t}} - 1 \right) & \text{for\ }t = 2019 \\
\frac{em_{\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t + 1}}{em_{\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t}} - 1 & \text{for\ }t > 2019 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

The index $\text{Eind}$ stands for the energy-related emissions in the
industrial sector.

Importantly, it is assumed that other pollutants $p$ are scaled on the
same industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions rate. In other words, emissions of
each pollutant for a year $t$ is the sum of emissions from the
previous year $t - 1$ adjusted by the change in industrial $CO_{2}$
emissions $\text{Δem}$.

For $t > 2019$:
$em_{\text{ocIpt}} = em_{\text{ocIp}\left( t - 1 \right)}*\left( 1 + \text{Δe}m_{\text{ocI},CO_{2},t} \right)$

#### Agriculture

Non-energy agriculture emissions are forecasted based on the GDP and
population growths (and a proxy for additional mitigation efforts – if
selected by the user).

For this section, $u = A$.

Agricultural emissions are projected using a similar approach to the
rest of CPAT: a reduced-form approach with elasticities, notably per
capita income $\epsilon_{Y}$ (GDP growth: $Y_{\text{grow}}$) and
population $\epsilon_{\text{lp}}$ specific to each UNFCCC emissions
sector (population growth: $lp_{\text{grow}}$).

In addition, the user has the option to assume that non-$CO_{2}$ GHGs
scale with fossil $CO_{2}$, which is a proxy for additional
(e.g., non-pricing) mitigation effort $(ame$) in the UNFCCC
categories. **This option, in effect, turns a carbon price into an
all-sector (incl non-energy sectors) GHG tax (incl. methane, N20 etc).**

For each pollutant and for $t > 2019$:

$em_{\text{ocApt}} = \frac{em_{\text{ocAp},t - 1}}{\text{am}e_{A,t - 1}}(1 + Y_{\text{growth}})^{\epsilon_{Y}}*\left( 1 + lp_{\text{grow}} \right)^{\epsilon_{\text{lp}}}*\text{am}e_{\text{At}}$

#### Land use, land-use change and forestry

LULUCF GHG are assumed to be flat in the baseline and policy scenario
for net sink countries (where sinks of GHGs exceed sources). For
countries where LULUCF is a source, we assume an exogenous decline of
2.5% per annum in both the baseline and policy scenario. The user should
note that this rate can be adjusted in the dashboard.

![](./03/media/image38.png)

Figure 3‑29: LULUCF emissions decline rate

At the global level, this aligns with approximately the midpoint of
IAMs’ projection for LULUCF. Where the country assumes ‘additional
mitigation effort in non-energy sectors’ LULUCF GHGs decline at the rate
of energy $_{}$.

For this section, $u = L$.

It is considered that a defined amount of emissions can be subtracted
yearly, based on the 2019 level. Therefore, we introduce the LULUCF
emissions decline $\text{Δe}m_{L,t}$ (in annual %, in absolute value
of the start year).

  - For $p = CO_{2}$:

In the case of $CO_{2}$, we create a condition to model the sink
activity of LULUCF ($em_{\text{ocLpt}} < 0$ or $> 0$). In both
cases, we subtract an annual capture of $CO_{2}$ based on the LULUCF
emissions decline $\text{Δe}m_{\text{Lt}}$. If the emissions of the
previous year $t - 1$ are positive, we scale the emissions with the
ratio $\frac{a\text{me}_{cLp,t}}{\text{ame}_{\text{cLp},t - 1}}$ with
$a\text{me}_{cLp,t} = \ \frac{em_{P,cLt}}{em_{B,cLt}}$, which
represents the ratio between energy-related emissions under a policy and
baseline scenario.

For $t > 2019$:

$em_{\text{ocLpt}} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
em_{ocLp,t - 1} - \left| em_{\text{ocLp},2019}*\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \right| & \text{if\ }em_{ocLp,t - 1} < 0 \\
\frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{a\text{me}_{\text{cLp},t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{\text{cLpt}} - \left| em_{\text{ocL},2019}*\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \right| & \text{if\ }em_{ocLp,t - 1} \geq 0 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

  - For $p = CH_{4}$:

The same logic as for $CO_{2}$ is used, without considering the
condition for sinks.

For $t > 2019$:

$em_{\text{ocLpt}} = \frac{em_{\text{ocLp}\left( t - 1 \right)}}{\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{P,Lt} - \left| em_{\text{ocLp},2019}*\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \right|$

  - For $p = N_{2}O$:

In the case of $N_{2}O$, we assume the level of emissions to grow
accordingly to the population growth $lp_{\text{grow}}$.

For $t > 2019$:

$em_{\text{ocLpt}} = \frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\left( 1 + lp_{\text{grow}} \right) - \left| em_{\text{ocLp},2019}*\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \right|$

  - For F-gases ($p = \text{PF}C_{s}$, $\text{HF}C_{s}$, $SF6$,
    $NF3$):

In the case of F-gases, we assume the level of emissions to grow
accordingly to the population growth $lp_{\text{grow}}$. However, it
is the only case where we do not consider the LULUCF emissions decline.

For $t > 2019$:

$em_{\text{ocLpt}} = \frac{em_{\text{ocLp},t - 1}}{\text{am}e_{B,Lp,t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\left( 1 + lp_{\text{grow}} \right)$

##### Waste and Others

For waste and other emissions, forecasted estimates are determined by
population growth.

For this section, we consider that $u = W$ and $O$, denoting
respectively Waste and Others type of emissions.

Waste emissions are projected using a similar approach to Agricultural
emissions: a reduced-form approach with population growth elasticity
$\epsilon_{\text{lp}}$ (population growth: $lp_{\text{grow}}$). We
include again the additional (e.g. non-pricing) mitigation effort
$\text{ame}$.

For each pollutant and for $t > 2019$:

$em_{\text{ocupt}} = \frac{em_{\text{ocup},t - 1}}{\text{am}e_{B,u,t - 1}}*\text{am}e_{P,ut}*\left( 1 + lp_{\text{grow},t} \right)^{\epsilon_{\text{lp}}}$

### National Determined Contributions

CPAT harmonizes National Determined Contributions (NDCs) for 192
countries to show target GHG emissions levels (excluding LULUCF) in
2030, based on several major NDC characteristics, that is conditionality
and sectoral coverage. This section presents the different types of
NDCs. Country cases illustrating how NDCs are calculated in CPAT are
presented in Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations.

#### Types of NDCs

There are different types of NDCs:

  - **Business as usual (BAU) targets**: NDC target is a percent
    reduction from the country’s BAU scenario. For example, Albania’s
    NDC is 11.5% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the baseline
    scenario in 2030.
  - **Fixed targets**: NDC target is a fixed level of GHG/CO2 emissions
    in target (future) year. For example, Argentina’s NDC is a cap of
    359 MtCO2e net emissions in 2030.
  - **Historical targets**: NDC target is a percent or fixed reduction
    from the level of emissions in past years. For example, Australia’s
    NDC is 26 to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030.
  - **Intensity targets**: NDC target is a reduction in emissions
    intensity. For example, Uruguay’s NDC is emissions intensity
    reduction (GHG/GDP) of 24% in CO2 from 1990 levels.
  - **Unquantifiable targets**: NDCs with no specific emissions
    reduction commitments. For example, Saudi Arabia’s NDC: “The Kingdom
    will engage in actions and plans in pursuit of economic
    diversification that have co-benefits in the form of greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emission avoidances and adaptation to the impacts of climate
    change, as well as reducing the impacts of response measures.”

NDCs could also present conditional and unconditional targets:

  - **Unconditional targets**: Countries would use their own resources
    and technologies to achieve unconditional goals.
  - **Conditional targets**: Countries would need international support
    to achieve these (more ambitious) goals.

#### Harmonization of NDCs: Country cases

CPAT excludes LULUCF emissions from NDC calculations, so in case LULUCF
emissions were included in initial document, the goals are recalculated
with LULUCF, using the latest available data for LULUCF GHG emissions
and user-identified growth parameters for these emissions. If not
stated, we assume that the NDC target includes LULUCF.

By default, CPAT models the impact of carbon pricing on energy-related
emissions. Hence, for countries with high levels of emissions from
non-energy related sources (agriculture, waste, LULUCF), the
calculations would imply a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC
goals. For more information, see Appendix D - Examples of NDCs
calculations, which presents examples of NDCs calculations.

## Fiscal revenues

The fiscal revenues section in the mitigation tab of CPAT is organized
as follows:

  - Additional information, including **total fuel expenditure** broken
    down per fuel and sector grouping and **revenues/losses from price
    controls** broken down per fuel. These data are not used in the
    calculation of fiscal revenues.
  - **Policy coverage** showing the percentage coverage of CO2 emissions
    under the policy selected and for each sector group and fuel.
  - **The different components of the fiscal revenues** detailed in the
    subsequent section.

### Overview

Revenues from mitigation policies are estimated by comparing any
revenues from the policy and fuel taxes, net of any outlays from fuel
subsidies, in the baseline scenario with those in the policy scenario.
Fiscal revenues in CPAT are calculated for several types of taxes, by
fuel and sector. Revenue-raising policies include carbon taxes, ETSs
with auctioned allowances, increases in fuel/electricity excises, and
reductions in fossil fuel subsidies. Revenue-reducing policies include
expenditures (e.g., on renewable subsidies) and regulations (which
reduce the base of pre-existing fuel taxes).

CPAT differentiates two types of revenues:

  - **Carbon tax revenues**, which are the result of the carbon tax
    multiplied by emissions factor and energy use.
  - **Full revenues**, which include other taxes, VAT changes, excise
    duties, existing ETS schemes, etc. The changing revenues according
    to a carbon tax are not just simple revenues but also any changes
    associated with full revenues. For instance, there could be changes
    in subsidies due to changes in energy consumed.

A general formula for fiscal revenues calculations is:

$\text{re}v_{\text{ocfgt}} = F_{\text{ocfgt}}*\varphi_{\text{cgft}}*\text{nc}p_{\text{ocfgt}}$

where $\text{re}v_{\text{cfgt}}$ is the fiscal revenues from fuel
$f$ in sector $g$, $F_{\text{cfgt}}$ is the energy consumption,
$\varphi_{\text{cgft}}$ is the sector-fuel coverage and
$\text{nc}p_{\text{cfgt}}$ denotes the tax (policy) rate per unit of
energy consumption.

In the dashboard, the graph below shows total additional (vs. baseline)
fiscal revenues from the policy net of renewable energy subsidies. Note
that this includes base effects on existing taxes and subsidies, so even
a revenue-neutral policy that nevertheless changes the base of existing
taxes will have some effects on these, net, revenues.

GDP](./03/media/image39.png)

GDP

The user can also see total revenues (i.e. not against the baseline
scenario) according to the different fuels net of subsidies.

### Total revenues raised by policy

Fiscal revenues are calculated according to the selected power model
(Elasticity, Engineer or Average) and are expressed in billions of
dollars (in real terms based on the year 2021) and % of GDP. Please note
that revenues can be broken down per fuel. Total revenues are composed
of:

  - **Revenues from the baseline scenario** raised for each fuel and
    sector coverage. The estimation of these revenues follows the
    general formula for fiscal revenues presented above (i.e. the carbon
    tax multiplied by emissions factor and energy use).
  - **Revenues from existing excises and other taxes, including
    consumer-side subsidies**. This describes all existing taxes and
    consumer side subsidies. Excise and other taxes are composed of:
      - Consumer-side subsidy: $cs_{\text{ft}}$;
      - Fixed/ad val part/other: $\text{fa}o_{\text{ft}}$;
      - Current carbon tax: $\text{xc}t_{\text{ft}}$; and
      - Current ETS permit price: $\text{xets}p_{\text{ft}}$.

For each fuel, we multiply the fuel consumption (minus the other energy
use part, which is assumed not to be covered by excises) by the sum of
all the current excises. If the existing ETS is EU ETS, then the excise
and other taxes from current ETS permit price are not taken into
account. It is worths noting that for coal and natural gas, the formula
below is used across sectors as these fuels are broken down per data on
excise taxes in the sector groupings (i.e. industry, buildings and power
sectors).

Revenues from existing excises and other taxes,
$\text{revEx}i_{\text{ft}}$, are thus estimated as follows:

$\text{revEx}i_{\text{ft}} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\left( cs_{\text{cft}} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{xc}t_{\text{cft}} \right) & \text{if\ }\text{ExistingETS} = \text{EUETS} \\
\left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\left( cs_{\text{cft}} + \text{fa}o_{\text{cft}} + \text{xc}t_{\text{cft}} + \text{xets}p_{\text{cft}} \right) & \text{if\ }\text{ExistingETS} \neq \text{EUETS} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

where $F_{\text{ft}}$ denotes energy consumption and
$F_{\text{oen},\text{ft}}$ energy consumption in the Other Energy Use
sector grouping.

For electricity, revenues from additional excise tax are also estimated
based on the power prices determined in the engineer power model. The
additional excise tax is multiplied by the energy use and the
consumer-side tax/subsidy in the residential sector and the tax/subsidy
on industrial users in the non-residential sector.

  - **Revenues from additional excise tax** (if it exists – additional
    excise tax can be inputted in the Manual Inputs tab.) raised for
    each fuel and sector, calculating as the additional excise tax
    multiplied by the energy use. For electricity, however, it is worth
    noting that revenues from additional excise tax relies on the
    engineer power model estimations.

  - **Revenues from VAT**. Following the same logic as for existing
    excises and other taxes and additional excise taxes, revenues from
    VAT are calculated across sector grouping as the multiplication of
    the fuel consumption (minus the other energy use part
    $F_{\text{oen},f,t}$, which is assumed not to be covered by the
    VAT) by the associated VAT payment rate $\text{va}t_{\text{cft}}$:

$\text{revVA}T_{\text{ft}} = \left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\text{va}t_{\text{cft}}$

For electricity, revenues from VAT are obtained by multiplying the
energy use by the VAT payment in the residential non-residential
sectors.

  - **Losses from producer-side subsidies**. Producer-side subsidies
    represent a loss and are thus subtracted from total fiscal revenues.
    They do not affect the calculation of prices in CPAT and thus
    revenues unless they are phased out, if they exist. Note that
    implicitly the underlined that we are using has already been
    adjusted for producer-side subsidies, in particular in the case of
    coal. Producer-side subsidies, $\text{cstP}s_{\text{ocft}}$, are
    defined as the product between the per-unit subsidies[^3_47],
    $\text{pus}F_{\text{ocft}}$, and the subsidized demand,
    $\text{subDe}m_{\text{ocft}}$:

$\text{cstP}s_{\text{ocft}} = \text{subDe}m_{\text{ocft}}*\text{pus}F_{\text{ocft}}$

where:

  - Subsidized demand is determined based on both global demand data
    from the IEA and domestic demand data directly estimated in CPAT.
    The estimation of subsidized demand differs depending on the fuel
    considered. For oil, subsidized demand is equal to global demand as
    it is a global traded product. Subsidized demand for coal and
    natural gas represent 50% of global demand and 50% of domestic
    demand. Finally for electricity, only domestic demand is used and
    depends on the power model selected. Subsidized demand can also vary
    according to the global energy demand scenario selected in the
    dashboard.

![Figure 66: Dashboard: Global energy demand
scenario](./03/media/image41.png)

Figure 3‑32: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario

  - Per unit subsidies are taken from the Prices section of CPAT. For
    coal, gasoline and natural gas, per unit subsidies correspond to the
    average across all sectors. Importantly, per unit subsidies are
    equal across sector grouping. For electricity, producer-side
    subsidies are retrieved from the non-residential sector
    (i.e. denoted as industrial sector) of the Power Prices section of
    CPAT, determined in the engineer power model.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Cost of renewable subsidies** (if applicable – renewable subsidies
    are defined by the user in the dashboard). If specified by the user,
    $\text{cstRe}n_{\text{ocft}}$ represents the cost of implementing
    renewable electricity subsidy (or tax). In addition, the user can
    also add renewable subsidies under the baseline scenario. This cost
    is thus equal to the product between
    $\text{pusRe}n_{\text{ocft}}$, the cost of renewable subsidies in
    $/kWh (in real terms) and, $g_{\text{ocft}}$, the electricity
    supplied in the power sector according to the power model chosen.

$\text{cstRe}n_{\text{ocft}} = \text{pusRe}n_{\text{ocft}}*g_{\text{ocft}}$

These costs are estimated for each renewable energy, that is wind,
solar, hydropower and other renewables.

### Additional information

Revenue or losses from price controls and total fuel expenditures can
also be found in the Fiscal Revenues section of CPAT. These estimations
are not used in the calculation of the total fiscal revenues.

#### Revenues/losses from price controls

Revenues/losses from price controls, $\text{ct}r_{\text{ocft}}$, are
calculated by multiplying fuel consumption across sectors (minus the
other energy use part, on which price control does not apply) by the
difference in fuel’s international prices from the current year to the
previous one,
$\text{pIn}t_{\text{ocft}} - \text{pIn}t_{\text{ocf},t - 1}$, and by
the portion of global energy price changes not passed-through into
domestic prices, $\text{pt}h_{\text{ocft}} - 1$.

$\text{ct}r_{\text{ocft}} = \left( F_{\text{ocft}} - F_{\text{oc},\text{oen},\text{ft}} \right)*\left( \text{pt}h_{\text{ocft}} - 1 \right)*\left( \text{pIn}t_{\text{ocft}} - \text{pIn}t_{\text{ocf},t - 1} \right)$

#### Total fuel expenditures

Total fuel expenditures are not part of the fiscal revenues, but show
the expenditures on fuel from a whole country perspective, as this is
often relevant in developing countries wishing to minimize their import
bill. Fuel expenditures are estimated for each fuel considered in CPAT
and are expressed as the product between prices and energy consumption
across all sectors.

## Monetized social costs and benefits

In this section, the theoretical framework is first presented in order
to explain the approach used to assess efficiency costs and domestic
environmental co-benefits. Then, this section describes how energy
externalities costs are estimated. Finally, these costs are used to
calculate monetized welfare benefits.

### Overview

Figure 3‑33 provides a representation of the fossil fuel market, where
supply and demand interact. Importantly, it is assumed that the energy
demand responds to prices in the private sector, although the
institutional setup could, in some markets, play a role in preventing
prices from determining supply and demand.

![Figure 67: Efficiency costs and co-benefits in the presence of
prior-tax and carbon charge](./03/media/image42.png)

Figure 3‑33: Efficiency costs and co-benefits in the presence of
prior-tax and carbon charge

At any point, the height of the demand curve reflects the benefit to
consumers from an extra unit of consumption, while the height of the
supply curve (drawn as flat here because constant returns to scale is
assumed) reflects the cost to firms of producing an extra unit. If there
is no pre-existing tax or subsidy in the market, the consumer and
producer price are equal, and the market equilibrium is efficient
(leaving aside environmental impacts) because the benefit to consumers
from the last unit consumed equals the cost to firms of supplying that
unit.

#### Efficiency costs without a prior tax

Introducing a carbon tax in a country is distortionary by nature from a
local perspective (since it does not correct for a local externality per
se), but with the aim of contributing to a global reduction in emissions
(i.e., it contributes to reducing global externalities). Suppose a
carbon charge, equal to a carbon tax times the fuel’s CO2 emissions
factor, is now applied to the fuel. The charge drives a wedge between
the price paid by fuel users and the price received by fuel producers
and reduces fuel use, resulting in an economic efficiency cost indicated
by the shaded triangle *abg*. This efficiency cost is equal to the loss
of benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, the integral under the
demand curve or trapezoid *adeg*, less savings in production costs to
firms, rectangle *bdeg*.

Alternatively, the efficiency cost can be interpreted as the loss in
consumer and producer surplus (*jkga*) less revenue gains to the
government where the latter is rectangle *jkba*. Consumer surplus
reflects the benefits of fuel use to consumers less the amount they pay
for the product (*jkga*) and is reduced from triangle *hkg* to triangle
*hja* by the carbon charge. Producer surplus reflects revenue gains to
firms less production costs consumption but is zero with and without the
carbon charge as constant returns are assumed.

#### Efficiency cost in the presence of a prior tax

It is now supposed that a prior tax on fuel use is applied. This prior
tax drives a wedge between the consumer and producer price in the
initial equilibrium as indicated in Figure 3‑33. The efficiency cost of
the carbon charge is now given by trapezoid *acfg*. Again, this reflects
losses in benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, trapezoid
*adeg*, less savings in production costs, rectangle *cdef*.
Alternatively, it is the loss in consumer surplus, trapezoid *jlma*,
less revenue gains to the government, rectangle *jlca*.

In this case the efficiency cost has two components: (i) one-half times
the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the overall CO2 reduction; and
(ii) the pre-existing tax per unit of fuel use, times the fuel
reduction, and aggregated across fuel markets.

#### Efficiency costs in CPAT

The efficiency cost can be (approximately) computed by the ‘Harberger
triangle’, that is, one-half times the carbon charge expressed per unit
of fuel use times the fuel reduction. If the carbon charge is applied to
multiple fuel products, the efficiency cost is the sum of Harberger
triangles across the fuel markets. Equivalently, the efficiency cost is
simply one-half times the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the
overall CO2 reduction, which corresponds to the integral under the
marginal abatement cost (MAC) schedule where the latter is the
horizontal summation of individual MAC curves for all the behavioral
responses promoted by the carbon charge.

In CPAT, the efficiency costs follow the Harberger methodology, i.e.,
efficiency costs are treated as deadweight costs, $\text{ddw}$. These
costs correspond to the area of the trapezoid described above, which is
expressed as follows:

$\text{dd}w_{\text{ft}} = \frac{\left( \text{nc}p_{\text{ft}} - xcp_{\text{ft}} \right)}{2}*(F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft})$

Where the first term
$\frac{\left( \text{nc}p_{\text{ft}} - xcp_{\text{ft}} \right)}{2}$
represents the average of new and pre-existing tax, respectively denoted
$\text{nc}p_{\text{ft}}$ and $\text{xc}p_{\text{ft}}$, and
$F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft}$ corresponds to the change in fuel consumption
from the baseline to the policy scenario.

#### Co-benefits

If it is now supposed that there are also local air pollution or other
domestic environmental costs associated with use of the fuel product as
indicated in Figure 3‑33. The reduction in fuel use from the carbon
charge reduces these costs by rectangle *ncfo*, which corresponds to the
domestic environmental co-benefits. In short, the area *acfg* is
presumably due to the externality created from fossil fuel use in the
first place – and hence that is why the entire *ncfo* area could be a
benefit. The net economic benefit is defined as the domestic
environmental co-benefits—excluding global climate benefits—less
efficiency costs. This is shown by trapezoid *noga*, as the co-benefits
exceed the efficiency cost. More generally co-benefits might offset a
portion of (rather than more than offsetting) efficiency costs in which
case net economic benefits are negative.

### Energy externalities costs

Externalities are deadweight losses from the tax before revenue
recycling and do not include revenue recycling and tax interaction
effects. In the dashboard of CPAT, energy externality costs are
calculated under the baseline scenario and include costs above the
marginal cost, that is costs related to air pollution, congestion, road
damage and accidents and global warming. The sum of these externalities,
including the supply costs and the potential VAT, actually defines what
is called the ‘efficient price’.

![](./03/media/image43.png)

Figure 3‑34: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario

These costs are displayed by fuel (i.e. coal, natural gas, electricity
and liquid fuel, gasoline, diesel, LPG and kerosene) and sectors
grouping (except for liquid fuels) and broken down by various
components:

1.  **Supply costs** as defined in the Prices section of CPAT.

2.  **Air pollution costs**. These costs are associated mortality and
    morbidity attributed to air pollution. Averted mortality is valued
    using a Value of the Statistical Life (with the method selected by
    the user) and morbidity, measured as years lived with disabilities,
    is valued using a fraction of wages. See Section 6.7 of the Air
    Pollution module for methodological details.

3.  **Road accident costs** and **Congestion costs**[^3_48]. The main
    road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in road
    accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle
    fleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion
    (from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in
    the vehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.).
    Externality costs are estimated based on the baseline and policy
    forecast (i.e. adjusted for the fuel price change using a
    country-specific elasticity) accidents/congestion. The monetary
    value of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical
    life) and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value
    of travel time) is then computed. Finally, the change in value of
    accident/congestion is divided by the change in motor fuel
    consumption.

4.  **Global warming costs** are by default defined at the global level.
    These costs are estimated based on the damage per ton CO2 (in real
    USD$ 2021) and the level of CO2 emissions under both scenarios. Note
    that several social cost of carbon can be selected:
    
      - The damage per ton of CO2 is by default set to a **social cost
        of carbon**, fixed to 75USD$ in 2030, implying an annual rise in
        real terms from 2018 of the social cost of carbon of 4%.
    
      - **Estimated social costs by Ricke et al. (2018)** for which the
        national social cost of carbon discount rate and elasticity of
        marginal utility can be modified. Note that Ricke et al. (2018)
        estimates are country specific. More information can be found in
        the tab “SCC” of CPAT.
    
      - The social cost of carbon can also rely on the **Global US EPA
        estimates** with a 2.5% discount rate.
    
      - Finally, the user can manually enter a social cost of carbon (in
        US$2021 per ton of CO2), assuming that the latter starts in year
        2021.

These options can be modified in the dashboard:

  - **Potential VAT** can be calculated on the supply cost only or on
    the supply cost augmented by all externalities (the default).

### Monetized welfare benefits

CPAT provides an assessment of climate co-benefits associated with
carbon pricing and fossil fuel price reform. Welfare benefits induced
after the introduction of the carbon tax include the monetized following
items (in real USD$ 2021), which are estimated based on the description
of the costs described in the above section:

1.  **Averted climate damages (national)** is defined as the difference
    between the total national global warming costs in the baseline and
    the policy scenario.
2.  **Averted air pollution mortality/morbidity** is taken from the Air
    Pollution module. The air pollution welfare gains are calculated
    from reduced mortality and morbidity attributed to improvements in
    air pollution. Averted mortality is valued using a Value of the
    Statistical Life (with the method selected by the user) and
    morbidity is valued as a fraction of wages. See Section 6.7 of the
    Air Pollution module for methodological details.
3.  **Averted road accidents** are taken from the transport module and
    represent the change in the number of road accidents induced by the
    implementation of the policy selected by the user, which thus
    corresponds to externality benefits.
4.  **Reduced congestion** is taken from the transport module. In the
    same vein, external benefits from reduced congestion results from
    the change in traffic induced by the implementation of the policy
    selected by the user.
5.  **Efficiency costs** are defined as the deadweight costs resulting
    from the carbon tax (i.e. the average of existing and new carbon tax
    introduced) and the change in fuel consumption for each fuel
    considered, including electricity.

CPAT dashboard shows monetized net welfare benefits as percentage of
GDP.

## Validation

### Overview

**It is important to note that the validation exercise differs from the
calibration**. While the calibration performed for some variables
throughout the mitigation module prevents the model from deviating from
observed data (i.e. for 2019 to 2021), particularly in the context of
Covid, the validation analysis covers a broader time horizon and aims to
explore how the mitigation module performs against other models or to
compare it against the literature. The analysis also includes
sense-checking and parameter sensitivity analysis of the parameters
defined in the mitigation module. The validation is organized as
follows:

1.  **Elasticities estimations**. As CPAT is mainly driven by
    elasticities with respect to prices and economic activity, an
    econometric analysis is carried out to compare the elasticities used
    in CPAT and those obtained from an empirical analysis.

2.  **Comparison of CPAT against other models**.

3.  **Ex-post studies**. This section presents the literature's
    estimates of the effectiveness of carbon pricing with respect to
    emissions and compares them to the CPAT results.

4.  **Hindcasting**. The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT's
    forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the
    performance of the used assumptions when trying to reproduce
    historical information.

5.  **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**. The analysis explores the
    sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.

Before deep diving into the validation analysis, a first step in the
validation process is performed to ensure that CPAT produces reliable
data, especially for the data fed into the rest of the validation
analysis. To further validate CPAT and check its functionality for all
countries the T and Tt scenarios have been created in the Multiscenario
Tool to test 826 parameters used in CPAT. The T-scenarios use average
power models and show how CPAT behaves under different carbon taxation
and how these parameters change. There are six testing scenarios:

1.  **T0-T6**, when T0 has no carbon tax;
2.  **T1** (small carbon tax scenario) introduces 12$ carbon tax with
    20$ target carbon tax;
3.  **T3** (medium carbon tax scenario) introduces 36$ carbon tax with
    60$ target carbon tax;
4.  **T6** (high carbon tax) introduces 120$ carbon tax with 200$ target
    carbon tax; and
5.  **The T2, T4 and T5** introduce intermediate rates for comparison.

In addition to these scenarios, the scenarios denoted Tt (i.e. T0t-T6t)
use engineer model instead of Average power models and hold the same
assumptions and carbon tax rates as the T scenarios described above
(i.e. T0-T6). In order to test CPAT, the following steps were performed:

1.  **Settings**. The T0-T6 use average model, while T0t – T6t scenarios
    use engineer model.

2.  **Model runs**. The MT is run using the same defaults.

3.  **Data**. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on
    826 parameters for 218 countries.

**The scenarios aim to provide data for further Parameter Sensitivity,
hindcasting and comparison analysis, as well as signal any problems with
country specific results**, i.e. due to the poor data quality. Based on
the outcomes, we classify countries into working and ones which produce
spurious results. The Table on Countries coverage presented in the User
Guide results from this testing.

### Panel estimation of energy demand

#### Introduction

This section describes the results from the estimation of some of the
fuel demand equations incorporated in CPAT. The aim is to

  - Deliver an empirical view of the elasticities with respect to price
    and economic activity;
  - Establish the size and direction of any linear trend in fuel
    consumption; and
  - Reflect on the difference between the value of the elasticities and
    trends estimated in this study and those currently used in CPAT.

Elasticities describe the percentage change in a dependent variable in
response to a percentage change in an independent (driving) variable. As
an example, a price elasticity equal to -0.3 implies that a 100%
increase in the price delivers a 30% reduction in fuel consumption. In
the case of models using data undergoing a logarithm transformation, the
elasticity with respect to a given variable is simply the estimated
coefficient on that variable.

#### Methodology

The approach used here reflects underlying CPAT model and database
structure in relation to:

  - **Frequency of data and timespan**. In the estimation we used annual
    data ranging between 2000 and 2018, i.e. the dataset currently
    incorporated in CPAT. This is a panel dataset in which information
    for a set of fuels consumed in a set of sectors (and their driving
    variables) is observed across time and countries (here taken as the
    unit dimension of the panel).

  - **Driving factors**. Consumption of a fuel in a specific sector is
    assumed to be a function of fuel price (in that sector) and of the
    overall level of economic activity (as measured by the GDP), with
    both variables expressed in real terms.

  - **Static functional form**. The whole impact of a change in a
    driving variable, say, price, unfolds within the year covered by
    that observation. This means that last year’s prices have no impact
    on this year’s and future consumption.

  - **Sectorial disaggregation**. Results are reported based on the
    disaggregation underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT
    (industrial, service, residential and transport) but data are
    available for a number of industrial subsectors and transport modes
    (as shown in Appendix B - Energy balances, Figure 3‑47) which are
    used in the estimation. This implies that we are able to produce
    estimates for the elasticities of a fuel consumed in any industrial
    subsector, so that the range of these estimates for the industrial
    sector as a whole is indicated as with a boxplot in Figure 3‑37 and
    Figure 3‑38.

  - **Fuel disaggregation**. Results are reported based on the fuels
    underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT (coal,
    electricity, natural gas, other oil products, biomass, diesel and
    gasoline). In the case of other oil products, we are able to rely on
    two fuels in the estimation: kerosene and lpg.

We estimated the fuel demand below for each combination of sector and
fuel for which estimation was deemed relevant and feasible:

$\begin{matrix}
\text{ln\:f}c_{\text{it}} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{1}\text{\:ln\:}y_{\text{it}} + \beta_{2}\text{\:ln\:}p_{\text{it}} + \beta_{3}\text{\:t} + \epsilon_{\text{it}} \\
\end{matrix},$

where $fc_{\text{it}}$ indicates the consumption of a specific fuel at
time *t* in country *i* in a specific sector, $p_{\text{it}}$
indicates the price for that fuel and $y_{\text{it}}$ the overall
level of GDP in the country. There are no indices in relation to the
sector and the fuel in the equation as estimation is conducted for each
combination of fuels and sectors. The individual effects $\alpha_{i}$
reflect constant (across time) factors which affect fuel consumption in
a specific sector in a specific country given the value of the
independent variables in the model. An example for these factors could
be energy efficiency policies affecting fuel consumption regardless of
the level of economic activity and price. Finally, $t$ is a linear
time trend. We also introduced a time effect $\lambda_{t}$ but it was
never found to be statistically significant when a linear trend was also
included.

In terms of relevance, we excluded sectors for which the CPAT dataset
contained data covering less than 0.5 GTOE while in terms of feasibility
we required a minimum of about 300 observations for a sector-fuel
combination to be included in the analysis. As a consequence, the number
of units (countyries) used in the analysis varied from more than 150 in
the case of gasoline used for road transport to 13 in the case of coal
used for non-energy use or otherwise not included in other industrial
subsectors.

##### Adopted estimators

The following estimators were implemented: 1) the between estimator
(BE); 2) the pooled OLS estimator (POLS) and; 3) the Common Correlated
Effects Mean Group (CMG) estimator of Pesaran (2006). The results from
the Between and Pooled OLS estimator are reported only for those cases
when they produce consistent estimates, ie. when regressors are not
correlated with individual effects as assessed by the Hausman test. The
choice of these estimators was motivated by the aim of assessing the
long-term impact of driving factors on fuel consumption - despite the
use of a static functional form in CPAT - and evidence of
Cross-Sectional Dependence (i.e. correlation across the units in a panel
dataset).

More precisely, the choice of adopting these estimators is motivated by
the following considerations:

  - The BE produces consistent estimates of long-run coefficients for a
    panel with adequate number of observations across time and units (in
    our case countries) as formally discussed in Pesaran and Smith
    (1995). It also produced the best estimate of long-run price
    coefficient for gasoline in the Monte Carlo simulation discussed in
    Baltagi and Griffin (1984), although estimates from POLS were not
    markedly different.

  - The POLS produced the most robust forecasts (assessed based on the
    RMSE) in the Monte Carlo study in Baltagi and Griffin (1984). In the
    same study, the BE produced very similar results, although with
    (slightly) higher errors.

  - The CMG estimator produces unbiased estimates when cross-sectional
    dependence (CSD), which was assessed based on the test in Pesaran
    (2015), is correlated to included regressors in the model. We used
    robust standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995; Driscoll and Kraay 1998)
    to take into account cross-sectional dependence but this is a valid
    approach only if the unobserved factors responsible for correlation
    across units are not correlated to variables in the model, in our
    case fuel price and GDP. Although the CMG estimator is robust to any
    form of Cross-Sectional Dependence, the extent to which it captures
    long-term impact of driving variables in a static model is not
    clear.

Two versions of the equation above are implemented in the case of the
POLS and CMG estimators: one with a global linear trend, one with a
trend allowed to vary across countries. Considering the number of
estimates we obtain we report only those which were statistically
significant at the 10% level and conform to economic theory,
e.g. positive elasticity on economic activity and negative on the fuel
price.

##### Data

Data used in this study reflects the dataset underlying CPAT. This means
using:

  - fuel consumption data from IEA energy balances;
  - nominal GDP data from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) database
    converted into real terms by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
    also from IMF’s WEO;
  - nominal fuel prices data from IMF’s database, also converted into
    real terms by using the CPI index.

All the variables were converted into logarithms before the estimation.

#### Results

##### Price elasticities

Figure 3‑37 compares the estimates of price elasticities obtained here
with those used in CPAT for the transport (quadrant A), residential
(quadrant B), industrial (C) and service sector (D). Estimated
elasticities are similar to those used in CPAT in the case of the:

  - residential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we
    estimated -0.1 - considerably lower than the -0.4 value used in
    CPAT;

  - industrial sector, with the of exception of diesel for which CPAT
    uses the high value of -1.1.

Difference between the elasticity in CPAT (-0.61) and the value
estimated here (-0.19) for gasoline in the transport sector might be
related to the fact that only the estimate from the CMG estimator can be
used in the comparison with CPAT. Low estimates for price elasticities
of gasoline in road transport are however very established in the
literature. A recent survey, Galindo et al (2015), indicated -0.10 and
-0.30 for short- and long-term elasticities, respectively, with our
estimate (-0.19) falling right in the middle of this range.

The difference between elasticities estimated here and those used in
CPAT is noticeable in the case of the Service sector. CPAT postulates
fuel consumption being more price responsive than demand in industrial
sector while our estimates point at elasticities being similar to those
estimated in the residential sector. Assuming that there is considerable
overlap between fuel uses in the service sector and in households (space
heating, air conditioning and everyday electrical appliances), our
findings of similar elasticities in the service and the residential
sector seem plausible. Considering the difference between our estimates
and CPAT and the growing importance of the service sector globally, this
is a topic which should be explored further in the next iteration of
CPAT.

estimated in this study for transport ( A), residential (B), industrial
(C) and service (D) sectors. The red triangles indicate an estimate
obtained from one of the adopted estimators, while the blue triangles
indicate the value of the elasticity used in CPAT. The boxplot in
subplot C indicates the range of the estimates obtained for the
industrial subsectors included in the study.

##### Elasticities with respect to economic activity

Figure 3‑38 compares the estimates of the elasticities with respect to
economic activity with the values used in CPAT for the transport
(quadrant A), residential (quadrant B), industrial (C) and the service
sector (D). Estimated elasticities are similar to those in CPAT in the
case of the:

  - residential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we
    estimated a relatively low (0.16) value compared to the value (0.65)
    used in CPAT;

  - industrial sector, with the of exception of natural gas for which
    CPAT uses a value of 0.81 while estimates here range between 0.33
    and 0.56.

Differences still emerge in the transport (quadrant A) and in the
service sector (quadrant D). With regard to the former, our estimates
(ranging between 0.31 and 0.53 across fuels) are close to the results
from the meta-analysis in Galindo et al (2015) indicating short- and
long-run income elasticities equal to 0.26 and 0.46, respectively. CPAT
is currently using the higher value of 0.57 for gasoline and 0.65 for
other oil products. With regard to the service sector, CPAT incorporates
a stark difference between elasticities for biomass and diesel (with
values up to 0.41) and those for electricity and natural gas (with
elasticity as high as 0.9). In contrast, our estimates are more
homogeneous across fuels with values at most as high as 0.7.

Figure 3‑38: Comparison between income elasticities used in CPAT and
those estimated in this study for Transport (A), Residential (B),
Industrial (C) and Service (D) sectors. The red triangles indicate an
estimate obtained from one of the adopted estimators, while the blue
triangles indicate the value of the elasticity used in CPAT. The boxplot
in subplot C indicates the range of the estimates obtained for the
industrial subsectors included in the study.

##### Linear trend

CPAT includes a term called “annual autonomous improvement in
efficiency” which conveys the annual percentage reductions in fuel
consumption due to increasing energy efficiency. The intensity of this
factor is stronger in the case of transport (average of about -0.5%
across fuels) compared to the other sectors for which average for each
fuel varies between -0.27 and -0.06%

Our estimate of a global linear trend for the sector-fuel combinations
included in this study presents quite a different picture, as a negative
trend in consumption could be estimated only for coal and other oil
products. In the case of biomass, electricity and natural gas the trend
is positive. In the case of diesel and gasoline consumption in the
transport sector, not reported in Figure 3‑39, the estimated models
pointed out at non-statistically significant linear trend.

![](./03/media/image48.png)

improvement in efficiency in CPAT and the global linear trend estimated
in this study. The red triangles indicate the average of the estimates
from the models allowing for a global linear trend.

#### Conclusions and areas for improvement

The empirical validation pointed out that the elasticities with respect
to price and economic activity in CPAT tend to be on the same ballpark
as those estimated here, with some exceptions mainly related to road
transport and the service sector.

This exercise pointed out that estimated global linear trends are
considerably different from the assumed impact of energy efficiency used
in CPAT. With hindsight, this is not surprising, as estimated global
linear trends include the impact of energy efficiency but also changing
preferences for a specific fuel or the impact of changing sector
decomposition. As an example, one would expect a positive linear trend
in the case of biofuels in the transport sector due to the impact of
policies facilitating substitution away from fossil fuels to renewable
sources. CPAT might benefit from continuing to disentangle the perceived
impact of energy efficiency (as currently done) especially if that
coefficient could be linked to explicit policymaking.

This empirical validation has provided an opportunity for a thorough
assessment of CPAT and how econometric analysis may inform values used
in the model. This resulted in a number of considerations that will be
explored in the next iteration of model development. In particular, CPAT
is likely to benefit from including:

  - Elasticities estimated on an extensive dataset spanning about 4
    decades which has been recently put together. Although this is a key
    development allowing the implementing of more sophisticated
    approaches and functional forms described below, as a first step, it
    seems helpful to focus on the estimators considered in this note.

  - A more focused measure of economic activity. The use of GDP to
    measures economic activity for each sector included in CPAT is not
    supported by best practice in the energy literature and involves the
    risk of producing unstable estimates, and therefore forecasts. As an
    example, if the share of a sector’s economic activity in the whole
    economy changes in a specific direction, CPAT would under- or
    over-forecast fuel consumption in that sector. As historical data
    for more focused economic activity indicators are available for all
    sectors in CPAT, one would need to assess whether one could obtain
    forecast time series which are needed by the model to make this
    approach feasible.

  - A more explicit treatment of long-run estimates. CPAT can
    incorporate the long-run / short-run distinction explicitly through
    an Error Correction Model (ECM) specification which is included in
    the macro-economic model of the World Bank or - perhaps more simply
    - maintain its current specification but include two sets of
    elasticities, one for long-run and the other for short-run
    forecasts, with the timing of the switch between the two informed by
    empirical evidence.

  - A more explicit analysis of the impact of cross-price elasticities.
    This is a very important factor for a model assessing consumption
    for each fuel like CPAT. Systematic approaches to fuel substitution
    bring their own set of challenges (Agnolucci and De Lipsis 2020), to
    the extent that a simpler ad-hoc method may be preferable at least
    as a starting point, perhaps focused only on the substitution of
    specific fuels in specific sectors.

  - Exploring feedback mechanisms between the variables incorporated in
    the model and their possible endogeneity. This does not seem a
    considerable concern considering the variables currently used in
    CPAT but may deserve its own empirical exploration if more focused
    indicators of economic activity (as consequence of point 2 and more
    likely to be endogenous) are used in the model.

  - Assessing the extent to which elasticities vary across sectors and
    countries. The current version of CPAT includes the possibility of
    differentiating elasticities with respect to price and economic
    activity based on whether a sector is in a country belonging to the
    Lower Income, Lower Middle Income and Upper Middle-Income group on
    one side, and High-Income Country. The next phase of model
    development should thoroughly explore this possible source of
    heterogeneity alongside other sources, e.g. the possibility of
    allowing heterogeneous responses across industrial subsectors.

  - Trying to disentangle the impact of energy efficiency from changing
    preferences for a specific fuel, either through variables related to
    explicit policymaking or incorporating evidence from specific policy
    events

### Model comparisons

Over the current section, we will compare CPAT results and projections
with other models over a selection of indicators. We will therefore:

1.  Compare CPAT’s baseline results against Enerdata and the IEA;[^3_49]
2.  Assess the sensitivity to carbon price against the Enerdata POLES
    model;
3.  Put the two together: compare CPAT time trend for different carbon
    prices vs alternative models.
4.  Explore the power sector results compated against selected results
    from EPM

#### Baseline validation

This section is dedicated to the assessment of the CPAT baseline
results. The latter is observed and compared with other models/sources
through time series. We use two sources for comparison. The first and
main source used is the Stated Policies (STEPS) scenario of the IEA
World Energy Outlook 2021, extracted from RFF’s Global Energy Outlook
2022 database. The second source used for comparison is Enerdata’s
long-term Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC).

In both cases, the comparison is established based on specific
indicators available in the different datasets (from Enerdata and from
the IEA). We will therefore challenge both Average and Engineer models
of CPAT.

##### Comparison with the STEPS scenario of the IEA

The IEA’s STEPS scenario reflects current policy settings based on a
sector-by-sector assessment of the specific policies that are in place,
as well as those that have been announced by governments around the
world.

Data for solar has been added manually from the IEA WEO 2021 as it was
not included originally in the RFF dataset.

We only have 3 points of data from the IEA: 2019, 2020, and 2030. The
indicators selected are: Total CO2 emissions, Primary energy consumption
by fuel, and Electricity generation by fuel.

Overall, the comparison shows comparable results between CPAT and the
IEA STEPS scenario. Indeed the figures below suggest outcomes of same
order of magnitude for the observed year (i.e. 2019, 2020 and 2021) and
long-term projections are similar.

![](./03/media/image49.png)

Note that it is not possible to observe the inflection point in 2022 in
the IEA projection, as data point for the year 2022 is not available. As
defined by RFF, Primary energy consumption displays the estimated energy
content of fuels consumed prior to any conversion process.

![](./03/media/image50.png)

Oil in CPAT is the aggregation of Diesel, Gasoline, LPG, Kerosene, and
Other Oil Products. A different aggregation could explain the difference
observed in order of magnitude for Oil.

![](./03/media/image51.png)

In Europe and Eurasia, discrepancies are mainly driven by the results of
Russia. It is important to note that there is no data for Solar
Electricity Generation per country in the RFF-GEO dataset for the IEA
STEPS scenario. Strong divergence should be noted between the two models
on the nuclear generation.

#### Carbon Price Sensitivity

The sensitivity analysis is the observation of the evolution of the
emissions depending on the carbon tax level. We will use the data from
Enerdata in order to establish the analysis. We are taking into account
both Average and Engineer models of CPAT. The graphs are indexed on the
baseline scenario, as a 100% of emissions.

We will only consider 3 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related
CO2 emissions - Power sector, and GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF. The focus
is at the world level, for the year 2030. We see good alignment between
the two models for all three indicators and both CPAT power model
choices (average or engineer).

Note here we abstract for any differences in baseline. See the previous
and next sections for that topic.

**Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector**

**Total GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF**

![](./03/media/image56.png)

#### Comparison with Enerdata’s long-term Enerbase scenario

*It should be noted that Enerdata’s scenarios were formed before the
Covid crisis.*

This comparison is based on different carbon tax scenarios (including
the baseline scenario), target for 2030: 0 USD/tCO2, 20 USD/tCO2, 40
USD/tCO2, 60 USD/tCO2, 80 USD/tCO2, 100 USD/tCO2, and 120 USD/tCO2.
These scenarios are computed using the average and the engineer models
of CPAT in order to add another layer of comparison. Enerdata presents
CO2 MACC, which is going to be used as an equivalent to the target
carbon tax. There are 3 points of data: 2025, 2030 and 2035.

We consider 5 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related CO2
emissions - Power sector - Industry - Buildings - Transportation, and
GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF.

Results show comparable results, with both models having similar slops.
Enerdata’s outcomes are, however, higher and aligned with pre-covid
results of CPAT, suggesting that the Covid adjustment implemented in
CPAT may explain the difference. In addition, it is worth mentioning
that CPAT is calibrated on IEA’s data in the year 2019 to 2021, and
IEA’s assumptions are less conservative than Enerdata when it comes to
the share of coal power plant in the future.

Overall, CPAT’s results are similar to Enerdata’s results. With a few
exceptions, the figures below report a similar order of magnitude and
comparable directions. In this comparison, the average power model of
CPAT provides closer estimates to Enerdata’s scenarios.

#### Power sector comparison vs. EPM

The power sector validation is made using the World Bank’s EPM model.
The World Bank’s Electricity Planning Model (EPM) is a long-term,
multi-year, multi-zone capacity expansion and dispatch model. The
objective of the model is to minimize the sum of fixed (including
annualized capital costs) and variable generation costs (discounted for
time) for all zones and all years considered, subject to:

  - Demand equals the sum of generation and non-served energy
  - Available capacity is existing capacity plus new capacity minus
    retired capacity
  - Generation does not exceed the max and min output limits of the
    units
  - Generation is constrained by ramping limits
  - Spinning reserves are committed every hour to compensate forecasting
    errors
  - renewable generation constrained by wind and solar hourly
    availability
  - Excess energy can be stored in storage units to be released later or
    traded between the other zones
  - Transmission network topology and transmission line thermal limits

The model is an abstract representation of the real power systems with
certain limitations. EPM is used mostly to perform least cost expansion
plans as well as dispatch analyses.

##### Objectives

The main objective of this analysis is to validate the accuracy of the
CPAT results by comparing them with selected results from the EPM model,
for different countries. The following outputs are compared:

  - Electricity Demand

  - Electricity Generation

  - New Investments

##### Methodology

The EPM model presents several different scenarios per country. Each
scenario is defined by a 2030 carbon budget, most of the time defined as
a 40% emission reduction relative to the BAU scenario. However, while
the carbon budget is an input for the EPM model, it is an output for
CPAT. Therefore, we used a goal seek in order to define a 2030 target
carbon price in CPAT, which brought us to $40 t/CO2. This is an only
approximately equivalent comparison: exact matching was difficult.

**We use the Engineer model of CPAT for the entire comparison.**

##### Caveats

Please note the following caveats on the approach followed:

  - EPM has a constraint in emissions and look to 2040 (80% emission
    reduction relative to BAU on average), but we work with 2030. In
    other words, we use a proportional ratio to set the target goal
    seek.

<!-- end list -->

  - The fuel classification in CPAT does not exactly match the EPM ones.
    Therefore EPM “Fuel oil” will be considered as CPAT “Other oil
    products” (“Oil” in the legend), EPM “Onshore wind” and “Offshore
    wind” will be considered as CPAT “Wind”, and EPM “Geothermal” as
    CPAT “Other RE”. Storage is invested in CPAT but not reported so we
    do not compare it here.

  - CPAT’s New Investments (MW) are considered spreaded in time, which
    explains their continuous aspect.

##### Comparison

The comparison in terms on types of fuels in the energy mix and the
order of magnitude of the shares reflect similar results. It is worth
noting that the EPM model shows a higher share of wind in the
electricity generation for some countries (e.g. Vietnam).

It is however more complicated to establish parallels in the case of
developing countries, as EPM can suggest discontinuous
generation/investments.

##### Graphs

The following pages show, for a number of mostly African countries
available in the EPM dataset, comparisons for the larger countries
between CPAT and EPM of:

1.  Overall electricity demand.

2.  Electricity generation by generation type.

3.  New investment by fuel type.

than previously, are available in the Appendix H.

### Ex-post studies

#### How effective is the carbon pricing, really? A literature review

Despite voluminous literature on the carbon tax, few empirical works
have investigated the effectiveness of a carbon tax and ETS in reducing
emissions. Figure 3‑40 provides a first attempt to compare the estimates
according to three different methods employed in the literature, that is
counterfactual scenario and the estimation of semi-elasticity. It is
worth noting that this comparison might be imperfect as under a
counterfactual scenario some estimates have been annualized based on the
policy implementation window, similarly to Green (2021). Moreover,
Figure 3‑40 reports both short- and long-term estimates.

Two main key findings stand out from ex-post quantitative assessments of
carbon pricing policies since 1990.

First, experience with carbon pricing and hence the empirical evidence
is primarily from developed and emerging economies. In particular,
studies assessing the effectiveness of a carbon tax focus on OECD
countries or Northern European countries, which implemented a carbon tax
earlier and for which time series data are available. Only few recent
studies evaluate ex-post estimates of the effects of carbon tax on CO2
emissions across the world. At the national level, particular emphasis
is placed on British Columbia, Sweden and the United-Kingdom. With
respect to the assessment of the ETS, the focus is, not surprisingly, on
the EU, China, Germany and the United States.

Second, the estimates for overall emission reductions from carbon
pricing are minimal to modest, falling in the range of 0 – 2 percent per
annum, with significant variations across sectors, but also across
countries (Green, 2021).

Nonetheless, several caveats have to be factored in before drawing
conclusion:

  - **Carbon prices so far have had low coverage, low prices, or both**.
    The sample size as well as the time horizon might still be too
    restricted to accurately examine the effect of a carbon pricing
    instrument. In this respect, empirical results acknowledge that the
    effects of taxes on emission reductions largely depend on the
    comprehensiveness of the instrument design and the level of the
    carbon tax (Metcalf, 2021).

  - **The carbon price appears to have a non-linear effect**, indicating
    that its effect becomes stronger above a certain threshold (Aydin &
    Esen, 2018). For instance, emissions reductions attributable to the
    EU ETS during the second phase (2008-2012) are greater than during
    the first stage (2005-2007). In the first phase, allowances were
    freely allocated. In the second phase, the cap was tightened and
    prices higher.

  - **Control variables introduced in empirical studies may poorly
    capture the effect of the instrument alone**. At the same time,
    isolating the effect of the carbon pricing instrument from other
    policies - which are not always considered as environmental policy
    measures - may lead to insignificant results. However, evaluating a
    carbon pricing instrument in conjunction with other instruments can
    lead to effectiveness (see, for example, Shmelev & Speck, 2018, who
    find that a carbon tax is effective when evaluated with a set of
    policies).

  - **The effects of rational ignorance may kick in and eliminate any
    impact**. Given the transaction costs of investing in low-carbon
    technologies, agents may not be responsive to a price signal set
    below a certain threshold.

  - **When it comes to the ETS, generalized free allocation can mitigate
    incentives** (e.g., through the creation of resource rents and
    barriers to entry). In addition, as more and more emissions are
    covered by ETSs (such as in China or in the EU) uncertainty on
    future prices may blunt the responsiveness of agents.

emission reductions: A literature review.

(Section 3.8.4.3). Study estimates are adjusted to derive annual
emission reduction effects of the carbon tax and the ETS to make
estimates comparable. ST = Short-Term semi-elasticity; LT = Long-term
semi-elasticity; CA-BC = British Columbia (Canada)

#### How does CPAT compare to the literature?

In order to compare CPAT’s semi-elasticity of CO2 emissions against the
literature, the following settings are used:

  - Due to low carbon prices, we employ a low step function, that is
    **$10 per ton of CO2**. Such a step function is comparable to
    studies estimating semi-elasticities.

  - The model is run for all countries for which data are available and
    factors in the total CO2 emissions of **171 countries**.

  - As CPAT is forward-looking, it covers the period **2019-2035**.

  - As most of studies analyzed their results against a counterfactual
    scenario, CO2 emission changes in CPAT are compared to the baseline
    scenario. The estimation of the short- and long- term
    semi-elasticities is calculated as follows:

<!-- end list -->

  - The total CO2 emissions in ton/CO2 are retrieved from CPAT under the
    baseline and policy scenarios over the period 2019-2035.
  - Annual changes are thus computed between the baseline and the policy
    scenarios.
  - **Short-term semi-elasticities** are arbitrarily calculated as an
    average of the annual changes over the period 2019-2023.
  - **Long-term semi-elasticities** are estimated as an average of the
    annual changes over the entire period (i.e. from 2019 to 2035).

<!-- end list -->

5.  Finally, CPAT holds the advantage to compare C02 emission changes
    **across sectors (i.e. industry, power, residential and
    transport)**.

The table below presents the results. Long-term semi-elasticities are
greater than short-term ones, indicating that changes that are not
possible in a short period of time are more realistic over a longer time
period. When looking into the range of CPAT’s estimates across all
sectors, results are comparable with those of the literature (see Figure
3‑40 above). At the sector level, the power sector records the highest
decrease on the long run, which is consistent with Rafaty et
al. (2020)[^3_50].

### Hindcasting

#### Objectives

The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT's forecasts against
observed data. It searches to evaluate the performance of the used
assumptions when trying to reproduce historical information. In short,
the process assumes an historical point in time as its base year, and
projects all relevant variables. Key indicators are selected and their
projections are compared to real/observed data.

#### Methodology

The current results were obtained using a hindcastable version of CPAT
(CPAT 1.0pre\_043) with the help of the Multiscenario tool (MT v219).
This is an out-of-sample forecasting exercise that simulates data from
the year 2000 onward. The analysis uses CPAT methods to forecasts
domestic prices, energy consumption and resulting emissions. Observed
international prices for the forecasted period were fed as inputs to the
simulation.

At the first stage, the focus is set on the forecasts of emissions; in
particular, on GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) and on energy-related CO2
emissions. The scenarios are run using six countries as test samples:

  - Australia (AUS)
  - Brazil (BRA)
  - China (CHN)
  - South Africa (ZAF)
  - United Kingdom (GBR)
  - United States (USA)

**No Policy interventions were modeled**, so the results correspond to
the ‘Baseline’ output of the model.

The hindcasting exercise relies on an adapted version of CPAT and the MT
files, where the first year of calculations is set to an historical
point in time. All relevant data tables (e.g. energy consumption and
domestic energy prices) are provided for that same base year. The
exercise focuses on testing emissions projections, and hence not all
features of CPAT are used.

The analysis covers annual data from 2000 to 2017, and assumes that
consumption of a fuel in a given sector is a function of sector-specific
fuel prices and overall level of economic activity, as measure by the
GDP. Default settings and no-policy interventions are used for
simulations.

The exercise consists of projecting key modeled variables and comparing
those simulations with observed information. The checks are done on a
country level basis, with a subset of those being presented here as a
sample of results. Results are presented by means of figures, and tables
of key statistics, namely the Root Mean Square error (RMSE) and its
normalized version.[^3_51]

#### Comparing projected emissions across selected countries

For the selection of countries, CPAT has been able to capture the global
trend in emissions. However, there are periods where the volatility of
projections is larger than that of observed data, and where local
trends, and in particular levels, are not properly captured. For a fixed
set of elasticities, this gaps with respect to observed historical
information can result from projected prices showing higher volatility
than observed ones. This is explored in a subsequent stage.

##### GHG (excl. LULUCF)

CPAT shows a good performance on projecting the trend of emissions in
most tested countries. A deeper look at the vertical axis’ scale of each
plot will show periods of increasing gaps between projected and observed
emissions. For a given set of price elasticities of demand, this could
be explained by an inverse gap in projected versus observed domestic
prices.

##### CO2 (energy-related)

The previous conclusions extends to the CO2 energy-related emissions.
This data, however, should be considered with care as the observed
emissions series exclude some years and a linear trend has been assumed
to interpolate data for these periods (see for instance, 2007-2014).

#### A potential source of discrepancies: In-model price forecasts

CPAT is an elasticity-based model where Emissions depend on fossil fuel
consumptions, which in turn depend on fuel prices. It follows that,
given the negative price elasticity of demand, an over-estimation
(under-estimation) of prices with respect to the ones observed in
reality, may lead to an under-estimation (over-estimation) of energy
consumption, and hence emissions. The case of China, is a clear example
of this. Projected prices are below observed historical ones. Since
elasticities were computed based on historical prices, this results in
higher hindcasted emissions than observed.

It should be noted, however, that the case of the UK escapes this
explanation. The hindcasting tool projects lower emissions despite the
lower modeled domestic prices. This gap in projected emissions would be
amplified if considering in the model the policies that the UK
implemented in the mid 2010s. These discrepancies remain for further
analysis.

The tracking of historical information by the simulations may also be
improved when setting short and long-term elasticities to model the
energy consumption behavior. The current exercise only considers the
former, and leaves the latter for further research.

As an additional remark, by construction, CPAT domestic prices for
fossil fuels track international market prices for these fuels, and are
adjusted with the help of an historical factor. The factor helps tame
the volatility. However, for some countries, domestic observed prices
remain smoother than projected ones. This may follow as well from
policies like existing price regulations, not modeled in the current
runs, and also left for further research.

##### Coal prices (projected, historical domestic and international)

Figure 3‑44: Historical retail prices of coal (domestic and
international)

##### All countries

When considering the coal prices used for the power sector in all
countries, it can be seen that CPAT forecasts are, on average, above
observed prices. The set of figures below, shows this through the
distribution of the relative difference (Projections/Observed), and its
concentration under the value of “1”.

A subset of years is taken as a reference, but the behavior is
consistent for all years. This reinforces the idea that a second set of
price elasticities of demand based on price projections may be needed.

$Observed domestic prices$

#### Conclusions and additional analysis needed

The hindcasting exercise was focused on projecting emissions (GHG and
energy-related CO2). It consists of a partial hindcasting, as the
international prices used as inputs correspond to the outturn of prices
(observed), instead of projections of prices dating from before the base
year selected. It can, hence, serve to better study how the forecasting
of domestic prices takes place once the true values of some inputs are
known.

For the countries analyzed, CPAT generally shows a good performance
capturing the historical trends of the respective variables. In most
cases, however, the volatility of observed data is not replicated with
CPAT projections. Moreover, depending on the country, CPAT’s projections
appear to be persistently under (over) estimating values with respect to
historical ones. While this may result from the implementation of
policies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from
discrepancies in price forecasting, and may be subject to additional
country-specific adjustments.

### Parameter Sensitivity Analysis

#### Objectives

The parameter sensitivity analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of
selected parameters with regard to:

  - The power sector assumptions;
  - Macroeconomic adjustments;
  - Elasticity adjustments; and
  - Price source adjustments.

The analysis aims to propose a classification of the sensitivity of the
parameters, i.e. how CPAT behaves when changing the default parameters,
and more especially how the change in parameters affects the emissions’
reductions.

#### Methodology

In order to test the sensitivity of the parameters, the following steps
were performed:

  - **Settings**. Default parameters are used for G20 countries and for
    a carbon tax increasing from 10$ to 75$.

  - **Model run**. The MT is run using the same defaults but changing
    one parameter only.

  - **Data**. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on
    emissions for G20 countries.

  - **Computation**.
    
    1.  Change in Emissions: Carbon Tax $75 in 2030 vs Baseline
    2.  Relative change (i.e. to the default parameter) in percentage
        points (pp). The difference between the change of CO2 emissions
        recorded under the default setting and the change in CO2
        emissions under the other options is computed in order to
        analyse how each option is sensitive to the baseline parameter.

  - **Output**. Create a sensitivity classification of parameters
    affecting CPAT’s behavior (no
    sensitivity/negligible/sensitivity/high sensitivity).

#### Results

Based on the methodology described above, the sensitivity of the
parameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions varies from **no effect to very
sensitive** when focusing on the relative changes (i.e. CO2 emissions
reduction relative to the default parameter). The following
rule-of-thumb is used to classify the sensitivity of the parameters:

  - No effect: no variation
  - Negligible: less than 2 percentage points
  - Sensitivity: between 2 and 5 percentage points
  - High sensitivity: more than 5 percentage points

The table below summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis.

### Appendix B - Energy balances

Energy balances are a key source of information for CPAT. While the
model uses energy consumption as a main input for the mitigation module,
energy consumption is itself built based on the structure and
information provided in the energy balances framework. This document
presents the main principles used to transform the energy balances
information into a structure consistent with CPAT’s fuels and sectors,
as well as the steps taken to build energy consumption tables based on
the CPAT energy balances.

![Figure 76: Mitigation module overview](./03/media/image78.png)

Figure 3‑46: Mitigation module overview

We use the IEA Extended World Energy Balances, and Enerdata Energy
Balances as the main sources to build the energy consumption tables used
in CPAT.

Starting from CPAT Prototype version 1.478, we separate biomass to
biogasoline, biodiesel and other biofuels.

#### CPAT energy sectors

The energy sectors in CPAT are based on the IEA Extended Energy Balances
dataset. We divide all energy flows into three main categories:

  - Raw energy supply,
  - Energy transformation, and
  - Final energy consumption.

For each country $j$, the balancing flow in raw energy supply category
is Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES), which should be equal to the sum
of Imports, Production, Exports (negative), Stock changes, International
marine bunkers (only on the world level) and International aviation
bunkers (only on the world level). Stock changes and bunkers were
combined in “Stock and bunker changes (STOCKCHA)” flow.

$\text{TPE}S_{j} = \text{Productio}n_{j} + \text{Import}s_{j} - \text{Export}s_{j} + \text{STOCKCH}A_{j}$

Energy transformation category includes the following IEA flows:
transformation processes (TOTTRANF, includes electricity generation),
transfers (TRANSFER), energy industry own use (OWNUSE), distributional
losses (DISTLOSS), and statistical differences (STATDIFF). The balancing
equation for total final consumption (TFC) is:

$\text{TF}C_{j} = \text{TPE}S_{j} + \text{TOTTRAN}F_{j} + \text{TRANSFE}R_{j} + \text{OWNUS}E_{j} + \text{DISTLOS}S_{j} + \text{STATDIF}F_{j}$

In transformation processes, we separate the power sector -
transformation of fuels into electricity. We include main activity
producer electricity plants, autoproducer electricity plants, main
activity producer CHP plants, and autoproducer CHP plants. The main
sector groups in final energy consumption are:

  - Industry
  - Transport
  - Building
  - Power sector

We disaggregate transport and industry further to sectors.

![Figure 77: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT](./03/media/image79.png)

Figure 3‑47: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT

#### CPAT fuels and sectors overlap

The fuels and sectors specified above form an energy balances table in
the mitigation module, which shows the amount of fuels consumed by each
subsector in industry, transport, residential or other sector for energy
purposes, and the amount of fuels consumed in the power sector to
generate electricity (see the screenshot).

![Figure 78: Energy Balances](./03/media/image80.png)

Figure 3‑48: Energy Balances

As the energy balances and prices are the main inputs for the Mitigation
module, it is also essential to understand the overlap between energy
prices and energy consumption by sector and fuels. The table below
depicts the energy consumption table obtained in CPAT following
transformations from international sources and CPAT’s own projections.
For fossil fuels and electricity we have sector-specific or general
energy prices and taxes per energy unit (please see a separate
documentation on CPAT Prices and Taxes), for renewables we use price
indices instead.

Figure 3‑49 explains the overlap of CPAT energy prices and sectors.

![Figure 79: CPAT energy prices and sectors
overlap](./03/media/image81.png)

Figure 3‑49: CPAT energy prices and sectors overlap

#### Energy Consumption (EC) construction for CPAT

The purpose of this section is to present the sequence of processes
applied to build and project Energy Consumption data in CPAT format,
that is also sufficiently derived from original international sources.
This process is applied as well to build a set of time series of Energy
Consumption used for regression analysis and hindcasting.

Raw Inputs:

  - Energy Balances (EB) from IEA (yearly information. 2018 and 2019)
  - Energy Balances (EB) from Enerdata (yearly information. Last update:
    2018)

Intermediate inputs:

  - CPAT projected Energy Consumption (EC) (2019)
  - User defined parameters for projections and for EC adjustment

Outcome:

Energy Consumption tables created using CPAT own structure, assumptions
and projections based on raw data published by international databases.
The table below depicts an example structure of such table:

![Figure 80: Energy Consumption](./03/media/image82.png)

Figure 3‑50: Energy Consumption

The CPAT energy consumption projections for the base year include a
sub-process under which the fuel transformation sector is created. In
CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings,
industry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation
in balances) and fuel transformation. Fuel Transformation sector is
determined by the difference between primary and final energy
consumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector.
Additionally, all oil products plus natural gas are aggregated to avoid
dealing with negative fuel consumption.

Summary: The following diagram summarizes the process.

![Figure 81: Energy Balances process](./03/media/image83.png)

Figure 3‑51: Energy Balances process

### Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology

Energy prices and taxes are among the main inputs of the Mitigation
module. They include information on (1) domestic energy prices by fuel
and sector, (2) governmental price controls, (3) international energy
prices and forecasts, and (4) existing carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon
taxes and ETS). This document reflects the main principles and data
sources used to build the CPAT Prices and Taxes part of the Mitigation
module and information on assumptions used in calculations and the main
outputs of the Mitigation module that directly depend on the prices and
taxes data.

![Figure 82: Mitigation module scheme: prices and
taxes](./03/media/image84.png)

Figure 3‑52: Mitigation module scheme: prices and taxes

The main data sources for prices and taxes inputs include:

  - For international energy price forecasts: energy price scenarios
    from the World Bank (Commodity Markets Outlook, “Pink Sheet” data),
    IMF (World Economy Outlook), IEA (World Energy Outlook), and EIA
    (International Energy Outlook);
  - For domestic energy prices and forecasts: historical fuel- and
    sector-specific prices from Enerdata, IEA, IMF FAD, and other
    sources;
  - For current carbon pricing mechanisms: historical and planned carbon
    taxation or ETS information, mainly based on the Carbon Pricing
    Dashboard;
  - For subsidies: IMF Energy Subsidies Template, ODI, other data
    sources

Based on the historical data and policy specifications, including
sub-sectoral exemptions, the Mitigation module calculates the changes in
energy prices and their impact on energy consumption (please see the
Mitigation module’s documentation for more details). These energy prices
also act as an input for other modules, including the distributional
module and the Transport module.

As one of the outputs, the Mitigation module calculates fiscal revenues
based on taxation, price controls, and energy consumption data.

#### User options affecting prices in CPAT

This section lists the user’s choices and briefly explains how these
choices will affect further calculations. For more details, please refer
to specific parts of this document.

![Figure 83: Dashboard](./03/media/image85.png)

Figure 3‑53: Dashboard

##### Policy coverage and exemptions

The user can choose what sector and fuel to tax on the Dashboard:

![Figure 84: Dashboard: Policy coverage](./03/media/image86.png)

Figure 3‑54: Dashboard: Policy coverage

Additionally, the user decides whether to phase out exemptions or not
and the period to phase out exemptions.

![Figure 85: Dashboard: Exemptions](./03/media/image87.png)

Figure 3‑55: Dashboard: Exemptions

Note: if the fuel is exempt and the phase-out is active, the carbon
pricing policy (new carbon tax or ETS) will increase by 1/n every year
starting from the chosen year, where n is the number of years to phase
out exemptions. The user can trace exemptions in the “New policy
coverage: CO2 emissions covered” graph on the Dashboard.

##### Choices of the sources for key inputs

The user can choose the source for international and domestic energy
prices:

![Figure 86: Dashboard: Sources for key inputs](./03/media/image88.png)

Figure 3‑56: Dashboard: Sources for key inputs

The options for key inputs include “manual,” which the user can fill in
a separate “Manual inputs” tab:

![Figure 87: Manual inputs](./03/media/image89.png)

Figure 3‑57: Manual inputs

##### Policy options: Existing carbon pricing policies

The user can choose to apply existing carbon tax or ETS (if they exist)
on the Dashboard:

![Figure 88: Dashboard: Policy Options](./03/media/image90.png)

Figure 3‑58: Dashboard: Policy Options

The user also has an option to specify carbon tax or ETS permit price
growth for future years in the “Advanced options” of the Dashboard:

![Figure 89: Dashboard: Advanced Policy Options](./03/media/image91.png)

Figure 3‑59: Dashboard: Advanced Policy Options

Note 1: even if the user decides not to apply existing carbon pricing
mechanisms, it will not affect historical prices, only forecasted.

Note 2: existing policy coverage for carbon tax and ETS permit prices
are fractional. When considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing
policies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is
affected by the policy. This differs from the treatment of coverage
under the new, user-defined, policies. There, the option to include or
not a sector or fuel is binary. For new policies, a fractional coverage
only occurs when the user selects to exempt a sector or fuel, and to
phase out that exemption in time.

##### Policy options: New excise / existing excise exemptions

The user can add a manual per-unit of energy excise by choosing the “Add
additional excise” option on the Dashboard and filling a relevant part
of the “Manual inputs” tab.

![Figure 90: Manual inputs: Manual Policy
Options](./03/media/image92.png)

Figure 3‑60: Manual inputs: Manual Policy Options

The user also has an option not to apply existing excise taxes starting
from the policy year (existing excises used by default):

![Figure 91: Dashboard: Existing tax removal](./03/media/image93.png)

Figure 3‑61: Dashboard: Existing tax removal

Note 1: if the user decides not to apply existing non-carbon taxes, this
decision will affect only policy forecast, not baseline and historical
data. Moreover, it the user decides to keep existing policies in place,
by default those will be projected with the existing sector and fuel
coverage and not with the one the user may use for newly-introduced
policies.

Note 2: As discussed before, existing policy coverage for carbon tax and
ETS permit prices are fractional, while the coverage for new policies is
binary. Indeed, when considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing
policies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is
affected by the policy. This differs from the treatment of coverage
under the new, user-defined, policies. There, the option to include or
not a sector or fuel is binary. For new policies, a fractional coverage
only occurs when the user selects to exempt a sector or fuel, and to
phase out that exemption in time.

##### Policy options: VAT reforms

The user can include externalities to be part of the VAT base for
optimal taxation (included by default):

![Figure 92: Dashboard: VAT Reform](./03/media/image94.png)

Figure 3‑62: Dashboard: VAT Reform

Also, the user can choose to apply the same VAT tax rate in the
residential and transport sectors if it is different from the general
VAT in the economy (“advanced options” in the Dashboard):

![Figure 93: Dashboard: Adjusting VAT per
sector](./03/media/image95.png)

Figure 3‑63: Dashboard: Adjusting VAT per sector

##### Fossil fuel subsidies reform

The user can choose to phase out fossil fuel subsidies (producer- and/or
consumer-side) over a specified period (n years). The fossil fuel
subsidy will decrease linearly by 1/n every year starting from the year
the user chose to start the phase-out until they reach zero or a
specified limit.

![Figure 94: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies
Reform](./03/media/image96.png)

Figure 3‑64: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform

Additionally, the user can choose to phase out only a part of the fossil
fuel subsidies in the “advanced options” of the Mitigation module.

![Figure 95: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (Advanced
Options)](./03/media/image97.png)

Figure 3‑65: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (Advanced Options)

##### Price liberalization

The user can choose to calculate the impact of the government energy
price control in the “advanced options” of the Dashboard and the source
for price control coefficients (manual or regional). The choice will not
affect historical price components but will affect calculations of
fiscal revenues or losses.

![Figure 96: Dashboard: Price liberalization (Advanced
Options)](./03/media/image98.png)

Figure 3‑66: Dashboard: Price liberalization (Advanced Options)

Note. Do not use price liberalization and fossil fuels subsidies phase
out simultaneously to avoid double-counting.

#### Price components

##### Assumed pricing mechanism

Figure 3‑67 below presents the main components of prices in the
baseline.

![Figure 97: Main components of baseline prices](./03/media/image99.png)

Figure 3‑67: Main components of baseline prices

**Supply cost** is an average price that includes all price components
like production and transformation costs, transportation and
distribution costs, profits, and others, except taxes.

**Retail price** is an average end-user price paid by the final user in
the corresponding sector (power generation, industry, transport,
residential) per unit of energy, including all applicable taxes and
subsidies. According to IEA, the historical retail prices are calculated
as a ratio of total sales of energy to the sold volume. The retail price
should equal the supply cost plus all relevant taxes:

$p_{\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{tt}x_{\text{cgf},t}$

where $p$ is the average retail price, $\text{sp}$ is the price
before taxes and $\text{ttx}$ is the total taxes for country $j$,
fuel $f$ in sector $s$ and year $t$. This holds for both the
baseline and the policy scenarios.

Note: In general, carbon pricing policies and the phasing out of
consumer-side subsidies will affect the $\text{ttx}$ component, while
the phasing out of existing producer-side subsidies will instead affect
the supply cost $\text{sp}$.

**Price gap/total taxes/subsidy**: the gap between the supply cost and
retail price. This is a function of any type of taxation and/or
subsidization that causes the supply cost to deviate from the
import/export parity price plus mark-ups and the any taxes applied to
the price before tax, such as VAT, excise taxes, and other taxes
(environmental, renewable support taxes, energy security taxes, social
taxes, and others). The historical values of $\text{ttx}$ are
calculated in the dataset as a difference between average retail price
and price before taxes and, thus, are negative in the case of a net
subsidy. For forecasted years, the value of $\text{ttx}$ will instead
be computed as the sum of the forecasted subcomponents (different types
of taxes and consumer-side subsidies).

$\text{tt}x_{\text{cgf},t} = p_{\text{cgf},t} - sp_{\text{cgf},t}$

where $\text{ttx}$ stands for the total net taxes (or net subsidy if
negative), $p$ is the average retail price and $\text{sp}$ is the
supply cost (i.e. the price before tax). By construction, this
relationship holds for all scenarios.

**VAT payment**: historical values are calculated in the dataset as VAT
base (price before tax plus all other taxes except VAT) multiplied by
the VAT rate. The VAT rate is assumed to be 0 for industrial and power
generation users since these users receive a credit on their input VAT.

$\text{va}t_{c,f,g,t} = \left( sp_{c,f,g,t} + \text{tx}o_{c,f,g,t} \right)*\text{vatrat}e_{c,f,g,t}$

where $\text{VAT}$ is the VAT payment per energy unit, $\text{txo}$
represents the excise and other taxes/subsidies and $\text{VATrate}$
is the VAT rate.

**Excise and other taxes**: calculated in the historical dataset as a
difference between retail price, supply cost, and VAT payment.

$\text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} = p_{\text{cgf},t} - sp_{\text{cgf},t} - \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t}$

For the forecasted years, instead, it is computed as the sum of its
projected components. This, as in the scenarios we decompose the Excise
and other taxes category to several additional price components, such as
*current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy, new excise
tax (if applicable), and fixed/ad-valorem part / other, which includes
price controls (if applicable)*.

These categories (except new policy and new excise tax), being the
Excise and other taxes category components, do not affect the retail
price.

  - Carbon tax/ETS permit price: ‘effective’ carbon tax/ETS permit price
    as a component of total taxes is calculated separately in CPAT based
    on existing carbon pricing mechanisms and emission factors. Details
    are provided below.
  - New policy/new excise tax: the main driver of the change in retail
    prices. They are calculated as components of the excise and other
    categories, depending on the chosen policy (new carbon tax, ETS,
    road fuel tax, others) and emission factors. By default, in the
    baseline scenario, new policy/new excise taxes are equal to zero.
  - Subsidies: per unit of energy subsidy is calculated as a sum of all
    subsidies over the total final consumption by sectors (power,
    industry, residential, transport). The details are provided below.

##### Assumptions used for price reconstruction and projections

**Retail prices**:

  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab
  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist
  - Otherwise, calculated as a sum of the supply cost, VAT and other
    (excise + environmental) taxes

**Supply costs**:

  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab

  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist

  - Otherwise:
    
      - For the first year: if no data whatsoever, uses the global
        (regional if possible) price
      - For the second year and after, calculated as the previous year’s
        supply cost multiplied by the global (regional) prices’ growth
        rate

**VAT payments**:

  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab

  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist

  - Otherwise:
    
      - For the first year:
        
          - For the power and industry sectors, assumes 0
          - for the residential and “all” sector, calculated as the sum
            of the supply cost and excise and other taxes multiplied by
            the general VAT rate in the country
    
      - For the second year and after, if no data, uses a proportion to
        the supply cost with other taxes from the previous year

**Excise and other taxes**:

  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab

  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist

  - Otherwise, if no data whatsoever: Assumes 0 for the first year, and
    uses a proportion to the supply cost from the previous year for the
    second year and after (would be changed later when we’ll have
    working carbon pricing mechanisms tab)

**Current carbon tax and ETS permit price**: Uses CPAT generated prices
if the data exist (would be changed later when we’ll have working carbon
pricing mechanisms tab)

#### Forecasted prices (after 2021)

##### Assumptions for forecasted prices

**Retail prices**: Sum of the supply cost and all applicable taxes:
excise and other + existing ETS/carbon tax + new ETS/carbon tax

**Supply costs**: Previous year’s supply cost multiplied by the growth
rate of the respective global fuel prices

**VAT payments**: Ratio of the previous year’s VAT payment to the supply
cost with excise and other taxes multiplied by the current year’s sum of
the supply cost and excise and other taxes (plan: should give the user
an option to apply VAT before or after taxes)

**Excise and other taxes**:

  - If “fixed” – equals to the previous year’s absolute value of the
    price gap that is not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax, plus
    applicable carbon pricing mechanisms (current/new ETS/carbon tax)
  - If “ad-valorem” – equals to the ratio of the previous year’s part of
    the price gap that is not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax to
    the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s supply cost, plus
    applicable carbon pricing mechanisms (current/new ETS/carbon tax)
  - Plan: additionally, should be corrected to the price control (as a
    part of the retail price that the government would change in order
    to keep the retail price controlled)

**Current carbon tax and ETS permit price**:

  - Values from the “Existing carbon pricing mechanisms (ETSs and carbon
    taxes) and price controls” New carbon tax and ETS permit price:
  - Values from the respective scenarios (zeroes for the baseline
    scenario)

##### Calculations: Modeling assumptions

For years starting from 2021, the price components are modeled by
following rules.

**Retail price** for fuel f in sector s in year t is a sum of the supply
cost and all applicable taxes (VAT payment, excise and other taxes):

$p_{\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{tx}o_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t}$

**Supply cost** for fuel $f$ in sector $s$ in year $t$ is
calculated using a coefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019)
to the global prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective
international fuel price in year $t$:

$sp_{\text{cgf},t} = \frac{sp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{gp_{f,t_{0}}}*gp_{\text{cf},t}$

where $sp_{\text{cgf},t}$ denotes the average supply costs for country
$j$, fuel $f$ in sector $s$ in base years $b$,
$gp_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}$ is the average global fuel price in base
years, $gp_{\text{cf},t}$ – global fuel price based on the chosen
international energy price forecast in year $t$. Notice that the
global price for certain fuels change from country to country, as the
reference market differs.

**Producer-side fossil fuel subsidy** is equal to the previous year’s
per unit of energy producer-side fossil fuel subsidy unless the user
decides to phase out fossil fuels.

**VAT payment** equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the
supply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:

$\text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t} = \frac{\text{va}t_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgf},t}$

**Excise and other taxes** components are decomposed into five
categories: current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy
component, new excise tax, and fixed/ad-valorem part/other taxes.

  - Current carbon tax and ETS permit price: if the user decides to
    apply existing carbon pricing mechanisms, the values will be
    calculated based on historical values and planned policies. If a
    country’s carbon pricing policy is not specified for years after
    2020, the current carbon tax / ETS permit price per energy unit,
    $\text{xcp}$, is calculated as:

> $\text{xc}p_{\text{cgf},t} = \text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t}$
> 
> $= \text{xc}t_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{CT}} \right)^{t - t0} + \text{xets}p_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{ETS}} \right)^{t - t_{0}}$
> 
> $= \text{XC}T_{c,t_{0}}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{XCT},\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{CT}} \right)^{t - t_{0}} + \text{XETS}P_{c,t_{0}}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{XETS},\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\left( 1 + \delta_{\text{ETS}} \right)^{t - t_{0}}$

As show above, the existing carbon price per energy unit results from
scaling the existing carbon taxes and ETS permit prices from the base
year, $\text{XCT}$ and $\text{XETSP}$ respectively, by their
specific coverage $\varphi$, the fuel-sector-specific emissions factor
$\text{ef}$, and the user-defined growth rate of the nation-wide price
for the forecasted years $\delta$.

  - New policy component:

$\text{nc}p_{\text{cgf},t} = \text{nc}t_{\text{cgf},t} + \text{nets}p_{\text{cgf},t} = \text{NC}T_{c,t}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgf},t} + \text{NETS}P_{c,t}*ef_{\text{cgf}}*\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgf},t}$

where $\text{nc}t_{\text{cgf},t}$ and $\text{nets}p_{\text{cgf},t}$
stand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per
energy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is
obtained based on the national price per ton of $CO2$
($\text{NC}T_{c,t}$ or $\text{NETS}P_{c,t}$), and scaling it by the
country-sector-fuel specific emission factors, $ef_{\text{cgf},t}$,
and the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies within the country in
question ($\varphi_{\text{NCT},\text{cgf},t}$ and
$\varphi_{\text{NETS},\text{cgf},t}$).

Among the options available, the user can select the sectors or fuel
that will be exempt of the policy implemented, as well as the linear
phase out of those exemptions, if selected by the user. This is already
considered in the sector-fuel coverage $\varphi$.

  - **New excise tax**: the user can specify additional per energy unit
    excise tax in the “Manual inputs” tab.

  - **Fixed/ad-valorem part/other**:
    
      - If the country’s taxation regime is “fixed,” this category
        equals the previous year’s absolute value of the price gap not
        covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT payment, corrected
        to price controls.
    
      - If the taxation regime in the country is “ad-valorem,” this
        category is equal to the ratio of the previous year’s part of
        the price gap not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT
        payment to the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s
        supply cost, corrected to price controls.

$\text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\frac{\text{Σfa}o_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}} & \text{if\ fixed} \\
 & \\
\frac{\text{fa}o_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\text{cgf},t} & \text{if\ Ad\ valorem} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

where $\frac{\text{Σfa}o_{\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}}$ represents
the average value of $\text{fao}$ during the base years.

#### Power generation costs: ‘Old’ cost model from IMF paper used only in elasticity based power model and only if ‘Old’ costs are selected.

Elasticity-based generation costs are defined as follows. The total unit
costs of generation (i.e. for each fuel type considered),
$\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}}$, is estimated as:

$\text{gn}c_{\text{ocft}} = \text{ef}c_{\text{ocft}} + \text{nf}c_{\text{ocft}} + \text{rp}s_{o,\text{cgft}} + \text{nc}t_{P,\text{cgft}}*\left( 1 - \text{te}x_{P,\text{cft}} \right)$

where:

  - $\text{ef}c_{\text{ocft}}$ denotes the effective fuel unit costs
    (i.e. after autonomous efficiency gains), which is defined as the
    retail price before any new policies adjusted from the autonomous
    efficiency improvement in generation.
  - $\text{nf}c_{\text{ocft}}$ is the effective non-fuel unit costs
    (i.e. after autonomous efficiency gains). For the base year,
    non-fuel unit cost is assumed as a fixed proportion through the
    period of costs that are non-fuel, $\gamma$:

$\text{nf}c_{\text{ocf},t_{0}} = \frac{\text{ef}c_{\text{ocf},t_{0}}}{\left( 1 - \gamma \right)}*\gamma$

For the following years, effective non-fuel unit costs are equal to
effective non-fuel costs from the previous year, adjusted from the
autonomous efficiency improvement. – $\text{rp}s_{o,\text{cgft}}$
denotes the renewable producer subsidies, which only apply to wind,
solar, hydro and other renewables.

#### New price target: Goal seek

When simulating the introduction of a new ETS permit, CPAT allows the
user to define, among others, the year of implementation, the initial
price/tax to be considered, and the level at which it should reach in a
‘target’ year. While still on a development phase, CPAT incorporates a
‘goal seek’ feature to help the user determine the new policy’s target
price based on an goal on the emissions level.

![](./03/media/image100.png)

Figure 3‑68: ETS target price - Goal Seek

Located to the right of the Advanced Options in the dashboard, the goal
seek allows the user to input:

  - The sectoral inclusion

  - The proportion of the industrial sector to be covered (if Industry
    is included)

  - The emissions target (in absolute terms, or the reduction
    percentage)

The lower part of the goal seek shows the emissions, by sector, for the
baseline and the policy. The ‘Total’ row shows, first, the aggregated
emissions (considering only the sectors included by the user), second,
the emissions goal, and third, the squared difference of emissions
between the baseline and the policy scenario.

While the user can apply the goal seek functionality in Excel, the
algortihm is not particularly useful in this case, and it is more
convenient to test the different target prices manually, step-by-step.

In brief, once the inputs of the Goal Seek feature are provided, the
user should check different alternatives of a target price and evaluate
how emissions perform under each one. This simplified tool aims at
giving a broad approximation of the price level required to achieve the
emissions goal for the target year.

### Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations

#### Example 1: Paraguay (BaU NDC)

NDC overview:

  - Unconditional target: 10% reduction relative to baseline emissions
    by 2030
  - Conditional target: 20% reduction relative to baseline emissions by
    2030
  - GHG covered: CO2, CH4, N2O
  - LULUCF emissions: included

Calculations in CPAT:

  - Baseline GHGs, excl. LULUCF in 2030: 48.8 MtCO2e
  - Baseline GHGs, incl. LULUCF in 2030: 94.9 MtCO2e

Based on NDC targets:

  - Unconditional NDC target: 10% reduction relative to baseline
    emissions by 2030 \* GHG excluding LULUCF:
    $48.8*\left( 1 - 10\% \right) = 43.9$ MtCO2e
    
      - GHG including LULUCF: $94.9*\left( 1 - 10\% \right) = 85.4$
        MtCO2e

  - Conditional NDC target: 20% reduction relative to baseline emissions
    by 2030
    
      - GHG excluding LULUCF: $48.8*\left( 1 - 20\% \right) = 39.0$
        MtCO2e
      - GHG including LULUCF: $94.9*\left( 1 - 20\% \right) = 75.9$
        MtCO2e

![Figure 99: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (% of
emissions reduction reduced)](./03/media/image101.png)

Figure 3‑69: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (% of
emissions reduction reduced)

#### Example 2: Colombia (fixed NDC)

NDC overview:

  - Unconditional target: 169.44 MtCO2e in 2030
  - Conditional target: N/A
  - GHG covered: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and black carbon
  - LULUCF emissions: included

Calculations in CPAT:

  - Baseline GHGs, excl. LULUCF in 2030: 218.8 MtCO2e
  - Baseline GHGs, incl. LULUCF in 2030: 302.6 MtCO2e

Based on NDC targets:

  - Unconditional NDC target: 169.44 MtCO2e (including LULUCF) in 2030
    
      - GHG excluding LULUCF:
        $169.4 - \left( 302.6 - 218.8 \right) = 85.6$ MtCO2e
      - GHG including LULUCF: $169.4$ MtCO2e

  - Reformatting to baseline reductions in 2030:
    
      - GHG excluding LULUCF reduction:
        $1 - \frac{\left( 85.6 \right)}{218.8} = 60.9$
      - GHG including LULUCF reduction:
        $1 - \frac{\left( 169.4 \right)}{302.6} = 44.0$

  - Since NDC included LULUCF, we use 44% reduction as a target:
    
      - GHG excluding LULUCF target level:
        $218.8*\left( 1 - 44\% \right) = 122.5$ MtCO2e

![Figure 100: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (%
of emissions reduction reduced)](./03/media/image102.png)

Figure 3‑70: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (% of
emissions reduction reduced)

NB: **CPAT models the impact of carbon pricing on energy-related
emissions**. Colombia’s LULUCF emissions are 83.8 MtCO2e, about a half
of GHG emissions target in 2030. The harmonized calculations would imply
a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC goals. However, the user
should also consider measures that the country would take in other
sectors (agriculture, forestry, land use, sectoral policies) to achieve
NDC goals.

#### Example 3: Australia (historical NDC)

NDC overview:

  - Unconditional target: 26-28% reduction relative to 2005 emissions
    levels
  - Conditional target: N/A
  - GHG covered: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3
  - LULUCF emissions: included

Calculations in CPAT: \* 2005 GHGs, excl. LULUCF: 526.2 MtCO2e \* 2005
GHGs, incl. LULUCF: 617.2 MtCO2e \* Baseline GHGs, excl. LULUCF: 568.5
MtCO2e \* Baseline GHGs, incl. LULUCF: 546.0 MtCO2e

Based on NDC targets:

  - Unconditional NDC target: 28% reduction relative to 2005 levels:

  - GHG excluding LULUCF: $526.2*\left( 1 - 28\% \right) = 378.8$
    MtCO2e

  - GHG including LULUCF: $617.2*\left( 1 - 28\% \right) = 444.4$
    MtCO2e

  - Reformatting to baseline reductions in 2030: \* GHG excluding LULUCF
    reduction: $1 - \frac{378.8}{568.5} = 33.4\%$ \* GHG including
    LULUCF reduction:
    $1 - \frac{\left( 444.4 \right)}{546.0} = 18.6\%$

  - Since NDC included LULUCF, we use 18.6% reduction as a target:
    
      - GHG excluding LULUCF target level:
        $568.5*\left( 1 - 18.6\% \right) = 462.7$ MtCO2e

#### Example 4: Uruguay (intensity NDC)

NDC overview:

  - Unconditional target: 24% reduction in emissions intensity relative
    to 1990
  - Conditional target: 29% reduction in emissions intensity relative to
    1990
  - GHG covered: CO2
  - LULUCF emissions: excluded

Calculations in CPAT: \* 1990 CO2 emissions intensity: 4.62 (tCO2e/LCU)
\* 2030 baseline CO2 emissions intensity: 3.593 (tCO2e/LCU) \* 2030
baseline GHG emissions, excl. LULUCF: 37.4 MtCO2e

Based on NDC targets: \* Unconditional NDC target: 24% reduction in
emissions intensity relative to 1990 levels: \* CO2 intensity:
$4.62*\left( 1 - 24\% \right) = 3.51$ MtCO2e \* Conditional NDC
target: 29% reduction in emissions intensity relative to 1990 levels: \*
CO2 intensity: $4.62*\left( 1 - 29\% \right) = 3.28$ MtCO2e \*
Reformatting to baseline reductions in 2030: \* Unconditional CO2
intensity reduction: $1 - \frac{3.509}{3.593} = 2.4\%$ \* Conditional
CO2 intensity reduction: $1 - \frac{3.28}{3.593} = 8.8\%$ \*
Converting to GHG emissions reduction goal: \* Unconditional GHG
excluding LULUCF target level: $37.4*\left( 1 - 2.4\% \right) = 36.5$
MtCO2e \* Conditional GHG excluding LULUCF target level:
$37.4*\left( 1 - 8.8\% \right) = 34.1$ MtCO2e

### Appendix F - Notation in CPAT

This table presents CPAT four key components (‘Modules’) and their
corresponding codes.

• Mitigation module – a reduced form energy model for projecting
emissions and estimating impacts of pricing and other mitigation
instruments on energy consumption, prices, GHG and local air pollutant
emissions, revenues, GDP, and abatement

• Air pollution module – a reduced form air pollution and health model
for estimating impacts on premature deaths and disease for local air
pollutants like PM2.5 and ozone;

• Distributional module – a cost-push model for estimating impacts of
changes in energy prices on industries and households (by income decile
and region), including recycling of revenues from mitigation policy.

• Transportation module – a reduced form model for estimating the
impacts of motor fuel price changes on congestion and road fatalities.

#### Sectors

This table displays the sector grouping used in CPAT. It shows the main
sectors (industry, power, buildings, transport, other) and the
corresponding codes. Each sector breaks into SubSectors, which have
their corresponding codes.

[^3_1]:  The mitigation chapter of the CPAT documentation was prepared by
    Alexandra Campmas, Daniel Bastidas, Olivier Lelouch, Faustyna
    Gawryluk, Paolo Agnolucci, and Stephen Stretton. Some sections are
    based on earlier papers by Ian Parry, Simon Black, Karlygash
    Zhunussova, Nate Vernon, Alexandra Campmas, and Stephen Stretton.
    Thanks to the whole CPAT team – and, in particular, to Simon Black,
    Karlygash Zhunussova, Paulina Schulz Antipa, and Samuel Okullo for
    useful comments, clarifications, and assistance in preparing this
    paper. CPAT has benefited from the extremely helpful comments of our
    initial reviewers in early 2021 including, among others, Charl
    Jooste and Claire Nicolas; thanks also to Claire and Adam Suski for
    providing EPM comparison data. CPAT relies on the assistance of many
    parties for data and support, including other WB Global Practices
    (including Phillip Hannam from Energy GP, who helped develop the
    techno-economic power model) and other academic groups, including
    IIASA (who provided emissions factors). Thanks to Dirk Heine,
    Stephane Hallegatte, Simon Black, and Ian Parry for leadership and
    direction, and for originating what became CPAT. Thanks also to
    Somik Lall for leadership and guidance.

[^3_2]:  <sup>∗</sup> Corresponding authors: Alexandra Campmas
    (<acampmas@worldbank.org>) and Stephen Stretton
    (<sstretton@worldbank.org>).

[^3_3]:  
[^3_4]:  Victor Mylonas (WB) is listed on the IMF side reflecting his
    historical contribution to the mitigation module when working at the
    IMF.

[^3_5]:  Income and price elasticities are based on a literature review.
    Income elasticities might depend (implicitly) on the level of GDP
    per capita (user option).

[^3_11]: Used in the emissions accounting section. This category
    distinguishes between energy-related (E), (which includes power,
    transport, buildings, industry and other energy use), Industrial
    Processes and Product Use (I), Agriculture (A), Land Use, Land-Use
    Change and Forestry (L), Waste (W), and Other (O) emissions.

[^3_12]: For the aggregation of energy and emissions, sector groupings refer
    to buildings (i.e., residential, services, and food & forestry)
    industry, transport, and power. Some other calculations have
    different aggregations. For prices, sector groupings refer to
    residential, industry including services, transport, and power; for
    elasticities, sector groupings refer to residential, industrial,
    services (including food & forestry), transport, and power.

[^3_13]: The following abbreviations for fuels considered are used in the

[^3_20]: Empirical studies generally include rebound effects when estimating
    the total price elasticity of demand.

[^3_21]: Transport sector studies accord to the highest share of elasticity
    studies, mostly gasoline and diesel. For estimates see Tables A1-A4
    in Labandeira and others (2017).

[^3_34]: The choice of this period depends on the likely effects of the
    pandemic on CAPEX trends. Based on the available data for wind
    power, we observe that CapEx increases in 2020 and 2021 by 3% and
    1.5%, respectively and finally decreases in 2022 by the same amount,
    neutralizing the previous two increases. These variations somehow
    account for the effects of the pandemic on CapEx. Missing data
    points between 2020 and 2022 are filled in based on these rates.

[^3_35]: In CPAT, China, Japan and Korea are treated separately because their
    trends are very different from those observed at the regional level.

[^3_41]: To measure data in kWh, costs are divided by the ratio kW/kWh
    (i.e. 2h).

[^3_42]: The estimate is taken from the following article, based on Duke

[^3_46]: We calculate the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of GHG according to
    international norms (using GWP100, over 100 years timescale). This
    allows us to calculate a total Carbon Dioxide Equivalent
    (CO<sub>2</sub><sup>e</sup>) value. GWP is also calculated for
    short-term pollutants which have a cooling effect.

[^3_47]: For oil, it is worth noting that the component ‘other oil products’
    is removed from the calculation as these types of fuels (e.g. light
    fuel oil) are not subsidized.

[^3_48]: Note that road damage costs are also calculated in the Transport
    module. Resulting reduced road damage are currently not accounted
    for in welfare benefits, although they are also estimated in the
    Transport module (see Chapter Transport Module, Section Road
    damage).

[^3_49]: Note that additional comparisons are available on demand. Notably,
    additional comparisons were done disaggregating the results per
    country, per sector and per fuel when available.

[^3_50]: Rafaty et al. (2020) is comparable to CPAT in the sense that
    semi-elasticities are assessed globally and across different
    sectors.

[^3_51]: The RMSE and its normalized version measure how far the projections
    are from observed historical data. The RMSE is scale-dependant,
    while the normalized RMSE is not, allowing for comparison across
    series or countries. Here, the normalization was done using the
    averages of the observed series as reference.
