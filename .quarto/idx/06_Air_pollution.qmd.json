Local pollutants, such as BC, OC, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>\nand NMVOC are responsible for the formation of fine particulate matter\n(PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) pollution, with known\nhealth impacts. CPAT quantifies reductions in mortality and morbidity\ndue to air quality improvements as part of the co-benefits of carbon\npricing.\n\nThe air pollution module in CPAT is mostly based on models developed by\nexternal institutions and researchers, but also includes modeling\ndeveloped specifically for CPAT. The main inputs are: (1) energy\nconsumption in time and scenario by fuel type and sector from the\nMitigation module, (2) emissions factors net of projected average use of\npollution control equipment, fuel processing and combustion method from\nGAINS model[^6_2], (3) concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone for\nthe baseline year, (4) emissions-to-concentrations relationships based\non source receptor matrices (TM5-FASST), regression analysis, machine\nlearning models, source apportionment studies and intake fractions, (5)\nrelative risk functions[^6_3] for exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and\nO<sub>3</sub>, and (6) population projections in time.\n\nThe main results from the air pollution module are mortality and\ndisability adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributed to air pollution\n(ambient and household) under the baseline and the carbon price\nscenario. Other outputs include the economic valuation of averted deaths\n(using a transferred value of the statistical life), health expenditure,\nworking days lost due to pollution and market output losses due to\nmorbidity and mortality.\n\nReduced-form approximations are used to estimate emissions,\nconcentration of pollutants and health effects. We use and adapt the\nresults of more complex models into simplified relationships. For\ninstance, in the case of the relationship between emissions of\npollutants and ambient concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone,\nCPAT includes the option to use the results from a linear emulator of a\ncomplex global chemical transport model. The results of the air\npollution module are in line with other more complex models (see section\n6.8 in Appendices), although both CPAT and the models to which we\ncompare to are subject to uncertainty and the results may be sensitive\nto the assumptions used. We address this issue in CPAT by allowing the\nuser to input local information, if available, and to switch among\nmethodological options (with the best options possibly dependent on the\ncountry chosen).\n\nAmong the caveats from the air pollution module, are the use of\ninternational databases, the country level and annual resolution of the\nanalysis and the uncertainty on estimations. Section 6.9 provides some\ninsights on how the user can tackle these caveats.\n\n## List of Acronyms\n\n**<span class=\"underline\">Institutions</span>**\n\nIHME Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\n\nIIASA International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis\n\nILO International Labour Organization\n\nIMF International Monetary Fund\n\nIPCC The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nOECD Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nWHO World Health Organization\n\n**<span class=\"underline\">Abbreviations</span>**\n\nBoD Burden of Disease\n\nCPAT Climate Policy Assessment Tool\n\nCLE Current Legislation Scenario\n\nCPI Consumer Price Index\n\nDALY Disability-adjusted life year\n\nEDGAR Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research\n\nEF Emission Factor\n\nFASST Fast Scenario Screening Tool\n\nGAINS Greenhouse Gas - Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies\n\nGBD Global Burden of Disease\n\nGDP Gross Domestic Product\n\nGEPR Getting Energy Prices Right\n\nGHED Global Health Expenditure Database, WHO\n\nGTP Global Temperature Potential\n\nGWP Global Warming Potential\n\nHAP Household air pollution\n\nIER Integrated Exposure Response\n\nLPG Liquified Petroleum Gas\n\nOAP Outdoors air pollution\n\nPAF Population Attributable Fraction\n\nPPP Purchasing Power Parity\n\nPTB Preterm birth\n\nRR Relative Risk\n\nSLCF Short-lived climate forcers\n\nTHE Total Health Expenditure\n\nTMREL Theoretical minimum risk exposure level\n\nUNFCCC United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\nVSL Value of the statistical life\n\nYLL Years of life lost\n\n**<span class=\"underline\">Pollutants and substances</span>**\n\nBC Black Carbon\n\nCH4 Methane\n\nCO Carbon monoxide\n\nHFCs Hydrofluorocarbons\n\nNF3 Nitrogen triflouride\n\nNMVOC Non methanic volatile organic compounds\n\nNOx Nitrogen oxides\n\nO3 Ozone\n\nOC Organic Carbon\n\nPFCs Perfluorocarbons\n\nPM2.5 Particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5\nmicrometers\n\nPOM Primary Organic Matter\n\nSF6 Sulphur hexafluoride\n\nSO2 Sulfur dioxide\n\n**<span class=\"underline\">Units</span>**\n\n6mDMA8h Six-month period with the highest mean, 8-h daily maximum\nconcentration metric\n\nGJ Giga Jules (1 GJ =10^9 jules)\n\nµg/m3 Micrograms per cubic meter\n\nktoe kilotons of oil equivalent\n\nPJ Peta Jules (10^15 Jules)\n\nppb parts per billion\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Climate Policy Assessment Tool, CPAT, is a spreadsheet-based tool\naimed to be used by economists in finance ministries and international\nfinancial institutions. CPAT can help policymakers in the design and\ncomparison of carbon pricing reforms, to help them achieve their climate\nmitigation goals (Paris Agreement NDCs) and development objectives\n(SDGs) jointly.\n\nCPAT allows a rapid estimation of the potential effects of carbon\npricing reforms in terms of:\n\n  - Macroeconomic effects, such as GDP impacts, employment, fiscal\n    revenues, and tax evasion.\n\n  - Energy price changes, including distributional impacts among\n    households and profits from the oil and gas sector.\n\n  - Energy use and it’s impacts on emissions of local pollutants and\n    CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\n  - Development co-benefits, including reductions in mortality and\n    morbidity due to local air pollution and road accidents, traffic\n    congestion and reductions in the shadow economy.\n\nThe present document focuses on the methodology followed in CPAT to\nassess the air pollution development co-benefits of carbon pricing. \n\nFigure 6‑1 shows an overview of the methodology, where the red box\nhighlights the topics covered in this document. As presented in the\nfigure, the air pollution tab receives as an input the energy\nconsumption for the different sectors and fuels (from the Mitigation\ntab). Emissions (of local and global pollutants) are calculated in the\nMitigation tab of CPAT, but the data sources and methodology used is\ncovered in this document. Using the emissions, in the Air Pollution tab\nwe calculate for each year the concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and\nO<sub>3</sub>, the health impacts attributed to pollution (deaths and\nDALYs) and economic impacts of pollution.\n\nFigure ‑: Overview of CPAT methodology\n\n![](./06/media/image1.png)\n\nThe health impacts attributable to air pollution methodology is\npresented in Figure 6‑2. As shown in the figure, the total health burden\nof pollution is estimated for the baseline scenario and for the carbon\nprice scenario. The impact of the carbon price is then estimated as the\ndifference between the total burden under both scenarios.\n\nFigure ‑: Methodology for estimating health impacts of a carbon price\n\n![](./06/media/image2.png)\n\nThe methodological steps presented in Figure 6‑1 and Figure 6‑2 are\ndescribed in the following sections. Section 2 presents the sources and\nmethods for estimating emissions. Section 3 explains the relationship\nbetween emissions and ambient pollution. Section 4 introduces the\nquantification of the health burden of air pollution and Section 5\npresents the quantification of the economic impacts of pollution.\n\n## Methods for calculating emissions\n\nIn this section we explain how we calculate emissions in CPAT\n(Mitigation tab), using as input the fuel consumption by sector and over\ntime, and emission factors. Emissions will be used to calculate\nconcentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>.\n\nFigure ‑: Overview of CPAT methodology, highlighting Emissions\n\n![](./06/media/image3.png)\n\n### Data sources for emissions\n\n| Input                                         | Source                                                                                                        |\n| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Energy consumption by fuel and sector in time | CPAT mitigation module.

The GAINS\nscenario selected as baseline is the ECLIPSE\\_V5a\\_CLE\\_base. This\ndataset was created in Jun 2015 and it covers emissions from 1990 to\n2050 in five-year intervals. This baseline scenario considers current\nlegislation (CLE) and committed legislation. The emission factors were\ngrouped to reflect CPAT sectors and fuels, as described in Wagner et al.\n(2020).\n\nThe basic principle to estimate emissions in GAINS is presented in\nexpression ( 6‑1). Emissions are driven by activity levels (such as\nenergy consumption), emissions factors that depend on the process and\nfuel type utilized (if any) and technology implementations that account\nfor possible pollution control technologies (such as particulate\nfilters, electrostatic precipitators, among many others). The emission\nfactors used in CPAT include country specific technology\nimplementations, according to the Current Legislation Scenario.\n\n|                                                   |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $Emissions = FuelConsumption*Emission\\ Factors$ | ( ‑) |\n\nIn CPAT, the pollutants included are PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NOx,\nSO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NMVOC, BC, OC, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, while\nthe sectors and fuels for which we have emissions factors are presented\nin Table 6‑1.\n\nTable ‑: Emission factor sectors and fuels [^6_4]\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Sector</th>\n<th>Subsector</th>\n<th>Biomass</th>\n<th>Coal</th>\n<th>Diesel</th>\n<th>Gasoline</th>\n<th>Jet fuel</th>\n<th>Kerosene</th>\n<th>LPG</th>\n<th>Natural Gas</th>\n<th>Other oil products</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Power</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Residential</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Transport</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p></td>\n<td>Road transport</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Aviation</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Rail</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>Industries</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p></td>\n<td>Construction</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Food and Forestry</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Mining &amp; Chemicals</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Manufacturing</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Other Manufacturing</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td></td>\n<td>Services</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSource: Own elaboration based on (Wagner et al. 2020)\n\nThe EF from the current legislation scenario will change in time, as\nshown in Figure 6‑4.

To produce\nsource-receptor coefficients for every country inside those regions, we\napplied a down-scaling of FASST to produce country level coefficients.\nThe methods are described in (Aleluia Reis 2020).\n\nIn addition to the country down-scaling from (Aleluia Reis 2020), we\nproduced a downscale based in the population in the FASST regions and in\nthe countries inside those regions, as presented in expression ( 6‑4).\nIn some cases we applied the population downscale, when the performance\nof the method described in (Aleluia Reis 2020) is low.\n\n|                                                                                                                   |      |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $A_{i,j,country} = A_{i,j,region}*\\frac{\\text{Population}_{\\text{region}}}{\\text{Population}_{\\text{country}}}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nIf we multiply the emissions $j$ from the modeled sectors by the\ncorresponding $A_{i,j}$ coefficients, we obtain the “modeled”\ncontribution to$\\text{\\ i\\ }$(where $i$ is PM<sub>2.5</sub> or O3)\nin CPAT, using expression ( 6‑5).\n\n|                                                                                   |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{Modeled\\ }i_{t,s} = \\sum_{j}^{}{\\sum_{s}^{}{A_{i,j}*Emissions_{j,s,t}}}$ | ( ‑) |\n\n#### From FASST spreadsheet to CPAT\n\nIn the spreadsheet version of FASST (provided by Rita Van Dingenen),\nthere are two emission scenarios and each of them is compared to FASST\nbaseline scenario (there are 3 scenarios in total). In CPAT, we do not\nuse the FASST baseline scenario, but only two scenarios: baseline (as in\nCPAT) and carbon price (as in CPAT). We do not need to include the FASST\nbaseline scenario in CPAT because to quantify the changes in PM2.5 (or\nin O3), attributed to the carbon tax, we subtract the results from the\nbaseline and the carbon tax. In that operation, FASST baseline would be\neliminated anyways and because of that is not needed.\n\nThe following table presents the operations in FASST spreadsheet and\nCPAT adaptations.

The ambient concentrations predicted represent\npopulation weighted averages per country. At the moment CPAT offers the\nelastic net model option only for PM2.5.\n\nThe results of the elastic net model are combined with an OLS model. The\nresults of the OLS model are used only to distribute the contribution of\nmodeled PM2.5 among CPAT sectors, while the elastic net model is used to\npredict total ambient concentrations of PM2.5.\n\nThe following table summarizes the data sources used to develop the\nelastic net and OLS models.\n\nTable ‑: Data sources used in the elastic net and OLS models\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><strong>Variable</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Data source</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Emissions</td>\n<td>CAMS Global Anthropogenic v4.2, 2000-2020, monthly, 0.1°</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Concentrations</td>\n<td>CAMS Global Reanalysis (EAC4) monthly averaged fields (Inness et al.

Intake fractions were defined in Bennett\net al. (2002) as the integrated incremental intake of a pollutant,\nsummed over all exposed individuals, and occurring over a given exposure\ntime, released from a specified source or source class, per unit of\npollutant emitted. Intake fractions measure the change in\npopulation-weighted ambient concentrations of a pollutant\n(PM<sub>2.5</sub> in this case) per unit of pollutant emitted (Cropper\net al. 2012). Zhou et al. (2006) defined intake fractions as the\nfraction of material or its precursors released from a source that is\neventually inhaled or ingested by a population. Intake fractions are\ndefined by expression ( 6‑35).\n\n|                                                                    |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |\n| $iF = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{P_{i}*\\mathrm{\\Delta}C_{i}*BR}}{Q}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere:\n\n> $\\text{iF}$: Intake Fraction, inhaled grams of PM<sub>2.5</sub> per\n> ton (ppm) of emissions\n> \n> $P_{i}$: population residing in a region located at a distance $i$\n> from the emission source\n> \n> $\\text{ΔC}_{i}$: change in ambient concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>\n> $g/m<sup>3</sup>$\n> \n> $\\text{BR}$: Average breathing rate in cubic meters per day\n> $m<sup>3</sup>/day$\n\n$Q$: Emissions rate $tonne/day$\n\nFrom expression ( 6‑35), rearranging the terms, we can express changes\nin concentration weighted average as shown in expression ( 6‑36).\n\n|                                                                           |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{P_{i}*\\mathrm{\\Delta}C_{i}} = \\frac{iF*Q}{\\text{BR}}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nIntake fractions are influenced by the emissions height, as illustrated\nin Figure 6‑10. Ground level emissions are usually inhaled in a mayor\nproportion, compared with emissions from a high stack.\n\nFigure ‑: Illustration of Intake fraction variation according to\nemissions height\n\n![](./06/media/image9.png)\n\n*Source: Parvez, Lamancusa, and Wagstrom* *(2017)*\n\nAt the same time, intake fractions depend on the population density at\ndifferent distances from the emission source. As illustrated in Figure\n6‑11, higher population concentrations will increase the intake\nfraction value, since more people is inhaling pollution.\n\nFigure ‑: Illustration of intake fractions variation according to\ndistance from the source and population concentration.\n\n![](./06/media/image10.png)\n\n*Source:* *(Lamancusa, Parvez, and Wagstrom 2017)*\n\n#### Intake fractions for ground level, low and high stack emission sources\n\nIn CPAT, for sources different than power plants, we use the results\nfrom Apte et al. (2012). The study estimates intake fractions for more\nthan 3,600 cities, for ground level sources and for direct emissions of\nPM2.5.\n\nIn the case of secondary pollutants, we will scale up the ground-level\nsecondary intake fractions from Humbert et al.(2011), presented in Table\n6‑11, using the ratio between primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> intake fractions\nfrom Apte et al. (2012) and Humbert et al.(2011), as indicated in\nexpression ( 6‑37).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    |      |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{iF}_{\\text{secondary\\ pollutant}} = \\frac{\\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ Apte}}{\\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ Humbert}}*\\text{iF}_{\\text{secondary\\ Humbert}}\\ $ | ( ‑) |\n\nTable ‑: Intake fractions (ppm) for ground level PM<sub>2.5</sub>\n\n| **Pollutants**                 |                                   | **Urban** | **Rural** | **Remote** |\n| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |\n| **Primary PM<sub>2.5</sub>**   | **Ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub>** | 44        | 3.8       | 0.1        |\n|                                | high-stack                        | 11        | 1.6       | 0.1        |\n|                                | low-stack                         | 15        | 2.0       | 0.1        |\n| **Secondary PM<sub>2.5</sub>** | **SO<sub>2</sub>**                | 0.99      | 0.79      | 0.05       |\n|                                | **NOx**                           | 0.2       | 0.17      | 0.01       |\n|                                | **NH<sub>3</sub>**                | 1.7       | 1.7       | 0.1        |\n\n*Source: Humbert et al.(2011)*\n\n**For non-ground level sources, in which emissions take place trough\nhigh or low stacks, the** $\\text{iF}$ **is estimated according to\nexpression** ( 6‑38)**.**\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    |      |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{iF}_{high/low} = \\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ Fantke}*\\frac{\\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ \\ Humbert,\\ high/low}}{\\text{iF}_{PM2.5,\\ Humbert,\\ \\ groundlevel}}$ | ( ‑) |\n\n#### Intake fractions from power plants\n\nPower plants emissions are released from tall smokestacks and\nconsequently are likely to be transported long distances. In order to\ninclude the geographically extended effect of power plants emissions\ninto the analysis, we will use intake fractions that were developed\nspecifically for this sector, following Zhou et al. (2006).\n\nZhou et al. (2006) estimates intake fractions for 29 power plants in\nChina and proposes a methodology to calculate intake fractions in other\nregions of the world using population and precipitation data. The\nauthors extrapolated the intake fraction results to other sites using\nregression analysis (see Table 6‑13). This methodology (Zhou et al.\n2006) was applied by on the spreadsheet model developed by Parry et al.\n(2014) and subsequent IMF iterations.\n\nCPAT intake fractions use updated data regarding power plant’s location\nand population distribution around them, together with differentiating\nexposed population inside country borders and outside countries. The\nmethodology is illustrated in Figure 6‑12.\n\nFigure ‑: Methodology for estimating intake fractions for power plants.\n\n![](./06/media/image11.png)\n\nTable 6‑12 provides a comparison between the approach implemented by\nParry et al.

The\ndatabase contains 2,390 coal plants, 3,922 gas power plants and 2,290\noil power plants.\n\nThe team decided to use this database, since CARMA database has not been\nupdated since 2012 (Byers et al. 2019). Figure 6‑13 shows, as an\nexample, the location of the coal power plants included in the database.\n\nFigure ‑: Location of Coal Power Plants[^6_11]\n\n![](./06/media/image12.png)\n\nSource: Based on (Global Energy Observatory et al. 2018)\n\nZhou et al. (2006) requires estimating population around different\ndistances of each power plant. To estimate population inside different\ndistance buffers, gridded population data was obtained from the Center\nfor International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), from\nColumbia university. The population-count raster file used consists of\nestimates of human population (number of persons per pixel), consistent\nwith national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000,\n2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 (CPAT analysis is based on 2020). The data\nset consists of global raster files at 30 arc-second horizontal\nresolution (approximately 1 km at the equator). The 30 arc-second[^6_12]\ndata were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and\n1 degree resolutions (Center for International Earth Science Information\nNetwork (CIESIN) Columbia University 2018a). The team decided to use\nthis dataset, instead of Landscan 2017, since the former is available\nfree of charge, and both sources provide equivalent quality and\nresolution.\n\nThe methodology in Zhou et al. (2006) allows the inclusion of the\nvariable precipitations. Precipitations data[^6_13] was obtained from The\nMillennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) Climate and Land Cover, v1\n(1901 – 2000)[^6_14] (NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications\nCenter (SEDAC) 2005). This dataset contains raster grids for monthly\naverage precipitations.\n\nFor each power plant we built a distance buffer of 40 kilometers and we\ncompute the average precipitation inside that buffer.

We added this\noption since every method used is subject to uncertainty and using more\nthan one estimate will provide results in the middle range of different\nmodel estimates.\n\n### Modeled and total ambient pollution\n\nIn CPAT, we estimate emissions from the sectors and fuels presented in\nTable 6‑1 according to the methodology described in Section 6.4. Then,\nusing one of the six options described in section 6.5, we determine the\n“modeled” ambient PM2.5 (or O3). The modeled concentration accounts\nonly for fuel burning activities, but not for all ambient pollution.\n\nOther sources of pollution (not fuel burning) include resuspended dust,\nsea salt, forest fires, or other transboundary sources that contribute\nto observed PM2.5. We assume that the sources not modeled in CPAT\ncontribute a $C_{0}$ level to ambient pollution. We calculate the\nvalue $C_{0}$ for a baseline year, using expression ( 6‑45), and we\nassume it to remain constant across time.\n\n|                                                     |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{Observed}C_{t0} = Modeled\\ C_{t0} + C_{0}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nTotal ambient concentration each year $t$ is modeled in CPAT using\nexpression ( 6‑46).\n\n|                                                           |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{Ambient}C_{t} = \\ \\text{Modeled\\ }C_{t} + C_{0}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nFigure 6‑14 presents graphically the methodology applied: a constant\n$C_{0}$ and a modeled concentration that varies in time.\n\nFigure ‑: Illustrative example of the projection in time of ambient\nPM2.5 in CPAT\n\n![](./06/media/image13.png)\n\nSource: Own elaboration\n\n## Methods to calculate the health burden of air pollution\n\nThis chapter describes the methodologies and data sources used to\nquantify the health impacts attributed to air pollution in CPAT.

RR\nindicates the likelihood of developing the disease of effect in the\nexposed group, relative to those who are not exposed.\n\n|                                     |      |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{RR} = \\frac{y_{0}}{y_{c}}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere:\n\n$y_{0}$: the risk (or probability) that people with baseline pollutant\nexposure will be adversely affected\n\n> $y_{c}$: the risk (or probability) that people with control\n> pollutant exposure will be negatively affected.\n\nFor example, a RR for all-cause mortality equal to 1.03 per 10 µg/m3\nincrease in annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> means that a 10 µg/m3 increase in\nPM<sub>2.5</sub> is associated with a 3% increase in deaths from all\ncauses.\n\n**Hazard** represents an instantaneous event rate or the probability\nthat an individual would experience an event at a given point in time.\n\n**Hazard Ratio** is defined as the baseline hazard ($H_{0}$) divided\nby hazard in the control group ($H_{c}$).\n\n|                                     |      |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{HR} = \\frac{H_{0}}{H_{c}}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nHazard ratio is often interpreted as relative risk, but they are not\ntechnically the same. The main difference is that relative risk does not\nconsider the timing of the event but only the occurrence of the event by\nthe end of the observation period. The hazard ratio considers both.\n\n**Incidence** corresponds to the number of new cases of a given disease\nduring a given period in a specified population.

The methodology combines information\nregarding population exposure to ambient air pollution and an\nexposure-response relationship.\n\nFigure ‑: Method for burden of disease estimation\n\n![](./06/media/image16.png)\n\nSource: (World Health Organization 2018a)\n\nIn CPAT we implemented a method to assess jointly indoors and outdoors\npollution, described in Section 6.6.3.1. CPAT also calculates the\nimpacts of ozone pollution, as described in Section 6.6.3.3.\n\n#### Joint ambient and household air pollution, GBD 2019\n\nIn CPAT, we quantify the effects of air pollution following the\nmethodology of the Global Burden of disease study for 2019 (GBD 2019\nRisk Factors Collaborators 2020). The methodology uses and Integrated\nExposure Response (IER) approach, basing its estimates in studies for\nambient pollution, second-hand smoking and household pollution. This\nmethodology represents and upgrade from the previous version of the\nstudy and the main differences with the previous methodology are the\nfollowing:\n\n  - GBD 2019 no longer uses active smoking data in the risk curves. This\n    removes an important source of uncertainty\n\n  - New studies in China and other high-exposure settings are now\n    used[^6_20]\n\n  - No fixed functional form. Splines generated using MR-BRT\n    (meta-regression boosted regression trees)\n\nThe methodology implemented in CPAT assess jointly the effects of\nambient and household pollution. This feature is important because it\nallows the quantification of a possible increase in the use of solid\nfuels for cooking (leakage effects) and because household pollution is a\nmajor health problem in many countries of the world.\n\nThe relative risks used in CPAT from GBD 2019 are presented in Figure\n6‑18. In the case of ischemic heart disease and stroke, the RR\npresented is an average across all the age groups, which are defined in\nbuckets of 5 years[^6_21]. In CPAT, we work with the following age\ngroups: neonates, post neonates, under 15, 15 to 64 and 65 years and\nabove. We use the average relative risk withing each group.\n\nFigure ‑: RR from the Integrated exposure response function, GBD 2019\n\n![](./06/media/image17.png)\n\nSource: Based on (GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators 2020).\n\nNotice that the relative risk takes as a reference the minimum risk\nlevel for PM2.5, TMREL, defined as uniform distribution between 2.4 and\n5.9 µg/m<sup>3</sup>. In CPAT, we use as the TMREL the average between\n2.4 and 5.9, equal to 4.15 µg/m<sup>3</sup> of PM2.5. When pollution is\nbelow that level, we would obtain cero health effects attributed to\npollution.\n\nThe diseases and age groups covered by the methodology in CPAT are\npresented in Table 6‑14.\n\nTable ‑: Integrated Exposure Response function diseases from GBD 2019\nimplemented in CPAT\n\n| Cause                                                                        | Age Group                | RR                         |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease                                        | All ages                 | Constant across age groups |\n| Diabetes mellitus type 2                                                     | All ages                 |                            |\n| Lower respiratory infections                                                 | All ages                 |                            |\n| Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer                                          | All ages                 |                            |\n| Ischemic heart disease                                                       | Above 25                 | Changes with age           |\n| Stroke                                                                       | Above 25                 |                            |\n| Low birthweight diseases[^6_22][^6_23], excluding lower respiratory infections | Neonatal (under 28 days) | Constant                   |\n\nSource: Own elaboration.

The health impacts are quantified for\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a RR of 1.06 (1.02, 1.10)\nper 10 ppb of ozone, in the seasonal (six-month period with the highest\nmean) 8-h daily maximum concentration metric (6mDMA8h).

In WHO databases, average concentrations are available\nfor rural and urban areas for each country. In most countries, urban\npopulations, in average, are exposed to higher levels of ambient PM2.5.\nFigure 6‑21 presents an example of urban and rural PM2.5 for a group of\ncountries.\n\nFigure ‑: Example of urban and rural weighted average concentrations\n\n![](./06/media/image20.png)\n\nSource: (World Health Organization 2018b)\n\nIn CPAT, we also use the estimations of ambient PM2.5 from the GBD2019\nstudy. We assume the same ratio between urban and rural concentrations\nlevels from WHO (2018b) and the overall concentrations from GBD 2019.\nFigure 6‑22 presents the gridded values for ambient PM2.5 in 2019.\n\nFigure ‑: Gridded mean of PM2.5, year 2019\n\n![](./06/media/image21.png)\n\nSource: Own elaboration, based on IHME data.\n\n#### Household PM2.5 Exposure data\n\nAs we mentioned before, in CPAT we estimate jointly the impacts of\nambient and household pollution. To do so, we need to know the share of\nthe population exposed to household pollution and the exposure level to\nhousehold PM2.5. We again draw upon data from the GBD 2019 study.\n\nFigure 6‑23 a) shows the estimated evolution in the share of the\npopulation exposed to household pollution in time, while Figure 6‑23 b)\npresents the exposure level, in addition to the OAP exposure, for the\nWorld Bank regions. For the baseline scenario, we assume that the share\nof the population exposed, and the exposure level will be constant in\ntime, and equal to the estimated value for 2019.\n\nFigure ‑: Share of population exposed to household air pollution and\nLevel of additional population exposure to household air pollution\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><ol type=\"a\">\n<li><p>Share of population exposed to household air pollution</p></li>\n</ol></th>\n<th><ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n<li><p>Level of additional population exposure to household air pollution</p></li>\n</ol></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><span class=\"chart\">[CHART]</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"chart\">[CHART]</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nSource: IHME/GBD, provided by Michel Brauer\n\n#### Ozone Exposure data\n\nAs mentioned before, we use the seasonal 8 hours maximum daily value to\nestimate the health effects of ambient ozone pollution.

This is called a “leakage”\neffect and could increase both household and ambient pollution. Figure\n6‑25 illustrates the carbon pricing effects on fuels consumption.\n\nFigure ‑: Illustration of the impact on carbon pricing in the\nconsumption of fuels\n\n![](./06/media/image23.png)\n\nSource: Own elaboration\n\nThe demand for fuels, including the demand for biomass for cooking is\ncalculated in the Mitigation tab in CPAT. For details on energy demand\ncalculations, please refer to the Mitigation tab documentation.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 6‑25, the leakage into informal fuels could\nincrease the proportion of households exposed to HAP, the level of\nexposure to HAP and OAP. The assumption for OAP is that 100% of indoor\nemissions are eventually incorporated into ambient air (Chafe et al.\n2015). These ambient emissions are converted into ambient pollution\nusing the methodology selected by the user, as described in section 6.5.\n\nRegarding the indoors effect of solid fuel use, the total leakage is\ndivided in a fraction that increases the proportion of households and a\nfraction that increases the level of household pollution.\n\nIn CPAT, the defaults assumptions are that 50% of the increase in\ninformal fuels consumption goes to additional household consuming solid\nfuels and 50% to increased consumption within households that were\nalready using solid fuels.\n\nIn many countries is estimated that 90% of households or more use solid\nfuels for cooking. To make sure that the final proportion of households\nthat uses solid fuels for cooking, after leakage is considered, is less\nthan 100% (or another maximum value defined by the user), we adjust the\nfraction of the leakage that goes into the proportion of households.\nExpression ( 6‑66) corresponds to the final proportion of households\nthat uses solid fuels for cooking before adjustments.

This logistic function is presented in expression (\n6‑69), its applied to ambient PM2.5, to all-cause mortality and its\nparameters are β=0.006765865, with σ=0.007338828.\n\n|                                                                                                                                       |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\left( 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\left( 1 - Incidence \\right)*EXP\\left( \\beta*DeltaQ \\right) + Incidence} \\right) \\right)*Incidence*POP$ | ( ‑) |\n\n#### Depressive disorders\n\nAnother effect of ambient air pollution included in CPAT is depressive\ndisorders. Braithwaite et al. (2019) develops a metanalysis of studies\nlinking long-term PM exposure and depression. The author develops a\nlog-linear exposure-response function and uses a counterfactual value of\n10 µg/m3 for the UK and of 25 µg/m3 for global scenario. In the\nmeta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio for the association between\nlong-term PM2.5 exposure and depression prevalence obtained was 1.102\nper 10 µg/m3 (95% CI: 1.023, 1.189; p=0:011), indicating that higher\nPM2.5 exposure is associated with higher odds of depression.\n\nThey treat pooled ORs as equivalent to RRs. The relative risk can be\ncalculated according to expression ( 6‑70)\n\n|                                                                                                     |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $RR \\approx \\text{OR}_{10}*\\frac{{PM2.5}_{\\text{current}} - {PM2.5}_{\\text{counterfactual}}}{10}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere $OR_{10}$ denotes the OR per 10 µg/m3 increment in PM2.5\nexposure.\n\nIn CPAT, the counterfactual level, ${PM2.5}_{\\text{counterfactual}}$\nused is 25 µg/m3.\n\n## Methods to quantify the economic impacts of air pollution\n\nIn this section we describe the economic impacts of pollution included\nin CPAT. The metrics included are working days lost due to pollution,\noutput losses due to mortality and morbidity, and health expenditure. We\nalso explain how we value averted mortality, using a transferred VSL,\nthe time structure of averted deaths and the valuation of travel time\nsaved (used in CPAT Transport tab).\n\nFigure ‑: Economic impacts, CPAT methodology overview.\n\n![](./06/media/image24.png)\n\n### Data sources used to quantify economic impacts\n\nTable ‑: Summary of data sources used to quantify economic impacts of\npollution\n\n| Input                                                                              | Source                                                                       |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Absenteeism from work                                                              | (OECD 2020), (WHO 2019)                                                      |\n| Methodology for working days lost                                                  | Ostro (1987), Holland (2014), (IIASA 2017)                                   |\n| Methodology for productivity losses                                                | Personal communications with Maureen Cropper                                 |\n| Labor’s share of GDP                                                               | (Guerriero 2019)                                                             |\n| Employment to population ratio, unemployment, wages, growth rate of GDP per worker | ILOs indicators                                                              |\n| Real interest rate[^6_27]                                                           | World Development Indicators, World Bank                                     |\n| Health expenditure methodology                                                     | (Preker et al. 2016)                                                         |\n| Data on health expenditure                                                         | GBD Health Financing Collaborator Network (2019b)                            |\n| VSL                                                                                | (OECD 2012), (Narain and Sall 2016), (OECD 2021) and (OECD n.d.)             |\n| Time structure of averted deaths                                                   | (US EPA 2013)                                                                |\n| Travel time saved                                                                  | (International Road Federation 2018), (Robinson et al. 2019), Tomtom’s data. |\n\n### Working days lost\n\nWork absenteeism has direct costs because of wage losses and replacement\ncosts, and indirect costs in productivity, due to delayed work and\npossible interference with the work performed by co-workers and\nsupervisors.\n\nFigure ‑: Work absenteeism due to illness\n\n<span class=\"chart\">$CHART$</span>\n\nSource: (OECD 2020) and (WHO 2019)\n\nIn CPAT, we quantify working days lost attributed to pollution following\nOstro (1987). This methodology has been implemented in more recent\nliterature, such as Holland (2014) and (IIASA 2017). OECD research (OECD\n2016) and (OECD 2019) has also been based indirectly in Ostro (1987) but\nreferencing the work from Holland (2014).\n\nThe baseline absenteeism from work due to illness data used are the OECD\ndatabase “Absence from work due to illness” (OECD 2020) that covers 46\ncountries[^6_28] and “Absenteeism from work due to illness”[^6_29] from\nthe WHO (WHO 2019). Figure 6‑27 presents the data from the observed\ndatabases.\n\nSince not every country is covered in the databases, we adopt the\nfollowing assumptions for obtaining baseline absenteeism at a country\nlevel:\n\n  - If the country in included in the OECD database, we use OECD data.\n\n  - If no OECD data is available, but WHO data includes the country, we\n    use WHO adjusted by “employment to total population ratio, 15+” (ILO\n    n.d.).\n\n  - If no country specific data is available, we use the average value\n    among countries with the same income level.\n\n  - For low-income countries (that are not represented in either\n    database), we use the average from lower middle-income countries.\n\nTo calculate the share of work absenteeism due to illness that can be\nattributed to ambient PM2.5 pollution, we use the methodology from Ostro\n(1987). The study developed a log-linear function with\n$\\beta = 0.0046\\ $and $\\sigma_{\\beta} = 0.00036\\ .$ The attributable\nfraction of working days lost due to pollution is calculated using\nexpression ( 6‑71) and the total number of days lost due to pollution is\ngiven by expression ( 6‑72).\n\n|                                            |      |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ---- |\n| $PAF = 1 - e^{- \\beta*\\mathrm{\\Delta}C}$ | ( ‑) |\n\n|                                                                                                                                     |      |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{WDL}_{\\text{pollution}} = \\text{Pop}_{15\\ to\\ 64}*\\text{Per\\ person\\ WDL}_{\\text{baseline}}*(1 - e^{- \\beta*C\\ baseline})$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere ΔC is the current level of PM<sub>2.5</sub> minus a reference\nlevel for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, that is assumed to be 0 in this case.\n\nTo value the days of work lost due to pollution, we use mean monthly\nearnings of employees, ILOSTAT Labor statistics.\n\nIf no wage is available, the default value used is:\n\n|                                                                                                     |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $Daily\\ wage = \\frac{GDP*\\alpha}{N{^\\circ}\\ of\\ persons\\ employed}*\\frac{1}{N{^\\circ}\\ of\\ days}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere $N{^\\circ}\\ of\\ days\\ $= 12\\*20.\n\nWe consider working population from 15 to 64 years old, as in (IIASA\n2017).\n\n### Market output losses\n\nIn CPAT, we quantify market output losses using mortality and years\nlived with disability (YLD) attributed to pollution, following the\nmethodology in (Pandey et al. 2021) .

The probability\n$d_{25,29}$ is equal to the sum of the probability of dying at 25, at\n26, at 27, at 28 and at 29 years old, as shown in expression ( 6‑82).\n\n|                                                            |      |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $d_{25,29} = d_{25} + d_{26} + d_{27} + d_{28} + d_{29}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nFor simplicity and to keep the file size at a reasonable level, we will\nassume that the probability of dying at every age contained in each\nbucket is the same, and equal to the bucket dying probability divided by\n5, as presented in expression ( 6‑83).\n\n|                                                                      |      |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $d_{25} = d_{26} = d_{27} = d_{28} = d_{29} = \\frac{d_{25,29}}{5}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nThe survival probability for each age inside each age-bucket is\npresented in expression <span class=\"underline\"></span>( 6‑84)\n<span class=\"underline\"> </span>\n\n|                                                                                                                 |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\pi_{25,29} = \\left( 1 - \\frac{d_{25,29}}{5} \\right) = \\pi_{25} = \\pi_{26} = \\pi_{27} = \\pi_{28} = \\pi_{29}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nTo implement expression ( 6‑79), let’s do <span class=\"underline\">\n</span> $\\left( \\frac{1 + g}{1 + r} \\right) = a$.

(2016) to estimate the share of total health\nexpenditure than can be attributed to pollution. The assumption is a\nconstant expenditure per DALY (Disability adjusted life years).\n\nIn CPAT, we calculate the share of the total burden of disease that’s\nattributed to the 6 main causes related to pollution, using data from\nthe GBD Results Tool (IHME 2020).

It’s important to notice that the VSL does not represent\nthe value of individual lives. Rather, the VSL is a measure of the rate\nat which individuals are willing to exchange money to reduce small risks\nof death within a certain period of time. This concept is used in\nbenefit-cost analyses, and we include it in CPAT to assign a monetary\nvalue to averted mortality due to a carbon price policy.\n\nThe VSL can be transferred following the methodology from (OECD 2012;\nNarain and Sall 2016), according to expression ( 6‑90).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    |      |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{VS}L_{c} = VSL_{OECD,2005}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{c}}{Y_{OECD,2005}} \\right)^{b}*\\left( 1 + \\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}P + \\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}Y \\right)^{b}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere:\n\n$c$: Country to which VSL in being transferred to.\n\n> $\\text{VS}L_{OECD,2005}$: Median VSL in OECD countries in 2005, in\n> 2005 $USD PPP\n> \n> $Y$: GDP per capita in PPP\n> \n> $b$: Income elasticity for VSL in country c\n> \n> $\\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}Y:$ Income growth after 2005\n> \n> $\\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}P$: inflation according to consumer price index\n\nIn CPAT, we first transform OECD VSL from 2005 $USD PPP to 2011 $PPP,\nusing expression ( 6‑91).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                   |      |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{VS}L_{OECD,\\ t,2011PPP} = VSL_{OECD,2005}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{OECD,t}}{Y_{OECD,2005}} \\right)^{0.8}*\\left( 1 + \\%\\mathrm{\\Delta}P_{2005,2011} \\right)^{0.8}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nSecondly, we transfer the OECD VSL from 2014 (in 2011 $USD PPP) to the\ndestiny country, according to expression ( 6‑92)\n\n|                                                                                                      |      |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{VS}L_{OECD,\\ 2014} = VSL_{OECD,\\ 2014}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,2014}}{Y_{OECD,2014}} \\right)^{b}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nThirdly, we project VSL in time using projected GDP per capita for\ncountry c, according to expression ( 6‑93).\n\n|                                                                                       |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{VS}L_{c,\\ t} = VSL_{c,2014}*\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,\\ 2014}} \\right)^{b}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nFinally, we convert the VSL from 2011 dollars to dollars in the “Results\nYear” (equal to 2019), using the 2019 price deflator for the country of\ndestiny.\n\nIn CPAT, Income elasticity is assumed equal to 0.8 for high-income\ncountries and 1.2 for middle and low-income countries. The user can also\ninput manually a different elasticity and a different VSL value in the\nAdvanced tab of CPAT.\n\nTable 6‑17 and Table 6‑18 present the values assumed to transfer the VSL\nfrom OECD countries.\n\nTable ‑: Assumptions and data sources for VSL transfer\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><strong>Variable</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Assumption</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Source</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><br /><span class=\"math display\">VS<em>L</em><sub><em>O</em><em>E</em><em>C</em><em>D</em>, 2005</sub></span><br /></td>\n<td>3 million USD in 2005, in 2005 PPP dollars</td>\n<td>Table 6.1, (OECD 2012)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><br /><span class=\"math display\"><em>b</em></span><br /></td>\n<td><p>0.8 for high income countries</p>\n<p>1.2 for middle and low-income countries</p></td>\n<td>(Narain and Sall 2016)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nTable ‑: Consumer price index and GDP per capita, OECD countries\n\n| Year     | CPI OECD | GDP per head of population OECD (2011 $US PPP) |\n| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **2005** | 82.0     | 35,407.8                                       |\n| **2006** | 84.1     | 36,248.1                                       |\n| **2007** | 86.2     | 36,921.0                                       |\n| **2008** | 89.4     | 36,738.5                                       |\n| **2009** | 89.9     | 35,198.6                                       |\n| **2010** | 91.5     | 36,011.9                                       |\n| **2011** | 94.1     | 36,554.1                                       |\n| **2012** | 96.2     | 36,813.9                                       |\n| **2013** | 97.7     | 37,130.2                                       |\n| **2014** | 99.4     | 37,696.5                                       |\n| **2015** | 100.0    | 38,413.8                                       |\n| **2016** | 101.1    | 38,859.1                                       |\n| **2017** | 103.4    | 39,589.2                                       |\n\nSource: (OECD 2021) and (OECD n.d.).\n\n### Time Structure of averted deaths \n\nWhen quantifying and valuing premature mortality, it is often assumed\nthat there is a “cessation lag,” or time distribution of averted\nmortality after a reduction in exposure (US EPA 2013). The time\nstructure we selected assumes that 30% of mortality reductions occur\nduring the first year, 50% occurs over years 2 to 5 and 20% over years 6\nto 20, after the PM2.5 reduction takes place.\n\nWhen valuing averted mortality using the value of statistical life\n(VSL), it is possible to calculate the present value of the benefit from\nreduced premature deaths by applying the discount rate to the number of\ndeaths themselves and then multiplying by the VSL. In CPAT, the user can\nselect the discount rate among 3 options: i) a discount rate of 3%,\nconsistent with the recommendation in Robinson et al. (Robinson et al.\n2019); ii) a discount rate that represent the interest rate paid by the\ncountry’s government and iii) a manual input of discount rate. When\nusing a 3% discount rate, the present value of premature deaths reduced\nis 0.906 times the number of undiscounted premature averted deaths. When\nusing a higher discount rate, for example a rate of 8%, the factor is\nreduced to 0.798 (see Table 6‑19).\n\nTable ‑: Time distribution of averted premature deaths\n\n|                      |

In\nCPAT, we estimate excess travel time, increased road damage, increased\ninjuries, and additional vehicle operating costs attributable to\ncongestion. The methodology used is described in the document Road\nTransport documentation. Here we only describe the methodology used to\nquantify changes in travel time, in time units, with respect to free a\nflow condition.\n\nWe estimate travel time per vehicle-kilometer in free flow and in\ncongested conditions for 416 cities in 57 countries, using TomTom data\n(see equations ( 6‑95) and ( 6‑94)). The time domain used is “All Days\nFull Day”.\n\nCongestion travel time per vehicle-kilometer, $CongestionTT,$ is\ncalculated using expression ( 6‑94).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                              |      |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $\\text{CongestionT}T_{2019}\\lbrack min/vehkm\\rbrack = \\frac{\\text{AccumulatedTravelTim}e_{2019}\\ \\lbrack min\\rbrack}{\\text{TotalVeh}\\text{KM}_{2019}\\lbrack vehkm\\rbrack}$ | ( ‑) |\n\n$\\text{TotalVehicleKM}$ corresponds to the multiplication of the\nnumber of vehicles and the average distance traveled and is reported in\nthe TomTom database.\n\nThe travel time per vehicle-kilometer under free flow conditions is\ncalculated using expression ( 6‑95).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                 |      |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |\n| $FreeFlowTT\\lbrack\\frac{\\min}{\\text{vehkm}}\\rbrack = \\frac{\\text{CongestionT}T_{2019}\\ \\lbrack\\frac{\\min}{\\text{vehkm}}\\rbrack}{(1 + \\frac{CI_{2019}}{100})}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nWhere $\\text{CI}$ is the average congestion index in 2019.\n\nWe estimate vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita using total\nvehicle-kilometers from the World Road Statistics data (International\nRoad Federation 2018) and countries total population (World Bank Group\n2019). For those countries not included in the WRS database, we assume\nthe average vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita between the regional\nmean and the income level mean.\n\nUsing vehicle-kilometers traveled per capita, together with the\ncongestion index $\\text{CI}$ and the free flow travel time, we can\nestimate total travel time each year $t$, in time units, using\nexpression ( 6‑96).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |\n| $\\text{Travel\\ tim}e_{t} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{CI_{t}}{100} \\right)*FreeFlowTT\\left\\lbrack \\frac{\\min}{\\text{vehkm}} \\right\\rbrack*VehKm\\ per\\ capita\\left\\lbrack \\frac{\\text{vehkm}}{\\text{year}} \\right\\rbrack*UrbanPopulation_{15 + ,t}$ | ( ‑) |\n\nIn CPAT, there are estimations for the congestion index for each year,\nunder the baseline scenario and a carbon price scenario. Using the\nexpression ( 6‑96) we can quantify travel time for each year under each\nscenario. Time savings attributed to a carbon price are equal travel\ntime in the baseline minus travel time in the carbon price scenario.\n\nWe value those time savings following (Robinson et al. 2019). We value\ntravel time at a rate of 50% the after-tax wage rate. We use gross\nearnings[^6_35] data from ILO and then we apply a factor to estimate\nafter-tax wages. The factor used for OECD countries is the “average\nincome tax rate as % of gross wage earnings”. For other countries, we\nuse the average factor from OECD countries, equal to 16%. When we value\ntravel time savings, we do so by considering only the population above\n15 years old, since younger population does not participate in the labor\nmarket.\n\n**Some implied assumptions:** We assume that free flow travel time and\nvehicle-kilometers traveled per capita are constant in time.\nVehicle-kilometers traveled are the same across the population,\nregardless of age or other considerations. Tomtom’s data is\nrepresentative of vehicles not using their devices.\n\n### Value of morbidity using years lived with disabilities (YLDs)\n\nAnother approach to value morbidity in CPAT in based on a method\nproposed in World Bank Group (2022). Under this method, we convert YLDs\nto ‘annual disease days’ $M$ and we value them using a fraction of a\ncountry’s daily wage.\n\nFirst, annual disease days are calculated from YLDs, for each country\nas:\n\n|                                                               |         |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| $M = \\ \\sum_{c = 1}^{n}{\\text{YL}D_{c}*\\frac{365}{DW_{c}}}$ | ( 6‑97) |\n\nWhere:\n\n$\\text{YL}D_{c}$: years lost to disease c\n\n$DW_{c}$ : Average disability weight of disease c attributed to\nPM<sub>2.5</sub>\n\nThe cost of a day lived with a disease $c$, $c_{c}$, is calculated a\nfraction of the daily wage $w$ (in each country), as presented in\nequation XX. The term D corresponds is set at 0.4, and is associated to\nthe disability weight of a severe condition, with severely restricted\nwork and leisure activity and a substantial medical cost.\n\n|                                |         |\n| ------------------------------ | ------- |\n| $c_{c} = w*\\frac{DW_{c}}{D}$ | ( 6‑98) |\n\nThe average daily wage, $w$, was calculated using the methodology\nexplained in section 6.7.3.\n\nFinally, the cost of morbidity is calculated as the multiplication of\nannual disease days and the cost of each day lived with disease.\n\n|                                                       |         |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| $Cost\\ of\\ Morbidity = \\ \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{c_{c}*M}$ | ( 6‑99) |\n\nUsing this method to value morbidity attributed to air pollution, we\ncalculate the share of morbidity costs as a share of mortality costs.\n\n### Air pollution externalities per unit of fuel\n\nThe health impacts attributed to air pollution are calculated jointly\nfor ambient and household pollution (see section 6.6.3), following the\nmethodology from the GBD 2019 study (GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators\n2020). Although the health impacts are estimated jointly, we compute an\naverage externally cost per unit of fossil fuel burnt, which affects\nonly ambient pollution.\n\nAfter the health impacts have already been quantified, the air pollution\nexternality computation is made as follows:\n\n1.  We compute the average ambient air pollution attributed mortality\n    per µg/m3 of PM<sub>2.5</sub> as total mortality attributed to\n    ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> in a certain year (referred to as\n    “attributable burden” in previous chapters) divided by the total\n    ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> that year.\n\n2.  Using the emission factor (for each fuel and sector, for each\n    country) and the emissions-to-concentrations model selected, we\n    compute the ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> contributed by one unit of fuel\n    used (in µg/m3 of PM<sub>2.5</sub> per ktoe).\n\n3.  We multiply the average ambient air pollution attributed mortality\n    per µg/m3 (step 1) with the ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> contributed by\n    one unit of fuel used (step 2), obtaining the number of attributed\n    deaths by unit of fuel used (deaths/ktoe).\n\n4.  We multiply the metric calculated in step 3 with the VSL for the\n    corresponding year and country, obtaining the externality value in\n    dollars per ktoe. We add to this number morbidity costs (for ambient\n    air pollution), according to the methodology described in section\n    6.7.8.\n\n5.  We convert energy units to express the externality in a commonly\n    used metric for each fuel, considering the relevant calorific values\n    in each country and fuels densities when needed. For instance, for\n    gasoline, the externality is expressed as US$ per liter, while, for\n    coal, the externality is expressed as US$ per GJ.\n\n## Validation: comparison with other models\n\n### Health impacts of pollution\n\nIn the following figures, we compare CPAT results with external models.\nGreen dots represent CPAT results, and the blue line represents the\nresults from the external model. When the green dots are above the blue\nline (45 degrees line), CPAT estimates are higher, and when the green\ndots are below the line, CPAT estimates are lower.\n\nFigure ‑: CPAT estimation of ambient PM2.5 air pollution death rates\nversus GBD2019 estimates.\n\n<span class=\"chart\">$CHART$</span>\n\nSource: CPAT results and (GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators 2020).\n\n### Emissions\n\nFigure ‑: PM2.5 emissions in the transport sector, CPAT 2020 versus\nEDGAR 2015 and IIASA 2020\n\n<span class=\"chart\">$CHART$</span>\n\nSource: CPAT results, (European Environment Agency 2020) and (IIASA\n2015).\n\nFigure ‑: PM2.5 emissions in the power sector, CPAT 2020 versus EDGAR\n2015 and IIASA 2020\n\n<span class=\"chart\">$CHART$</span>\n\nSource: CPAT results, (European Environment Agency 2020) and (IIASA\n2015).\n\n### Concentrations: share of fossil fuels on ambient PM2.5\n\nFigure ‑.

Global databases are constructed using country\nlevel databases, but in many cases, they are adjusted and standardized.\nThis may lead to differences among the data used in CPAT and local\ndatabases. If differences among CPAT and local data is an issue, an\nadvanced Excel user could modify any inputs in CPAT, since the\nspreadsheet is open, but this would require a deep understanding of the\ntool.\n\nAnother issue to be aware of is the national and yearly scope of CPAT.\nThis can be a limitation of CPAT analysis because the dynamics of air\npollution can vary widely inside countries and throughout the year. CPAT\nintends to represent population weighted average air pollution for\naverage pollution during a calendar year.\n\nAnother caveat is the uncertainty on the calculation of emissions, the\nrelationship between emissions and ambient concentration, the health\nimpacts and the economic values used to monetize the impacts of\npollution. CPAT at the time is providing a central estimate for all\ncalculations, without indicating uncertainty on estimations. This caveat\ncould be partially addressed by using the “MT tool” (described in the\nuser guide) to do a sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used.\n\nIt is important to consider that, even though CPAT performs well when\ncompared to other more complex models, this does not guarantee that CPAT\nresults will always be consistent with other more advance models. We\nhave compared baseline estimates with external global sources, to make\nsure that we represent the baseline properly. Many checks have been\nperformed in the Mitigation module too, which results drive the air\npollution results. These checks do not guarantee that the policy impacts\nobtained using CPAT will be similar to those obtained from other more\ncomplex models. Further checks will need to be performed in a\npolicy/country-specific context. CPAT allows the user to change\nassumptions and inputs, such that the tool can be adjusted properly when\nneeded.\n\nOverall, the results from the air pollution in CPAT are conservative in\nthe sense the results are likely underestimating the health impacts of a\nclimate policy. This is the case in big part because the default\nconfiguration of the air pollution variables yields conservative\ncontribution from fossil fuels to air pollution. The user can change the\npredefined options and calibrate the tool to make the results consistent\nwith other sources of information available.\n\n## References\n\nAleluia Reis, Lara. 2020. “Down-Scaling FASST(R) to Country\nLevel.”Almeida, S.

The comments in the table do not include those\nwhere reviewers were already in agreement with CPAT. Most comments and\nanswers are a summary of the original version.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Comment</th>\n<th>Response 2021</th>\n<th>Response 2022</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Incidence rate vs. incidence proportion</p>\n<p>The methodology document provided the definitions for key technical terms, including that for the incidence <span class=\"underline\">rate</span>, which forms part of the overall method used in calculating the burden of disease. However, the definition presented in the document seems to be referring to the incidence <span class=\"underline\">proportion</span> and not the rate. In epidemiological terms, there is a distinction between the two measures</p></td>\n<td>Thanks for the precisions made on the definitions for incidence proportion and rate. We did use the correct measures, following the GBD study. We will correct the documentation.</td>\n<td>The comment was incorporated into CPAT documentation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>Age-group considerations for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)</p>\n<p>The methodology currently considers all age groups combined for LRTI estimates and relies on the same Integrated Exposure Response (IER) function across the board for this outcome. Exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia and is responsible for 45 percent of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years of age. Household air pollution is also a risk for pneumonia in adults, and contributes to nearly 28 percent of all adult pneumonia-related deaths. Given implications from the application of carbon pricing, especially in relation to leakage to biomass, and households opting to use solid fuels for cooking and heating as a result, mortality estimates among those in the under 5 years old age-group is likely to increase. Therefore, stratifying LRTI cause-specific mortality by age-group to capture this specific age-group would be of extremely high relevance – even more so from an operational perspective.</p></td>\n<td>We fully agree that a disaggregated analysis by age group, in buckets of five years would be the best approach, and even more disaggregated to include neonatal effects. Unfortunately, in CPAT we are working with more aggregated age groups: Under 15, 15 to 24, 25 to 64, above 65, and neonatal. We did this aggregation due to limited file size in the tool. Because of this, we cannot differentiate the effects among children under 5, but hopefully we will use a more disaggregated analysis in the CPAT version outside Excel.</td>\n<td><p>As before, more detailed disaggregation is not feasible in the Excel version of the tool. But the aggregates estimate of CPAT replicate well the results obtained with more disaggregated data.</p>\n<p>In countries with high household pollution, after a carbon price we generally obtain a net reduction in health effects, despite increase household health effects.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Considering methodology applied in the Household Air Pollution Intervention Tool (HAPIT) to estimate health benefits</td>\n<td>The team provided a comparison between HAPIT and CPAT, concluding that CPAT is based on more recent methodologies, but HAPIT does a better job differentiating exposure among women, children and men. This element could be added in a future CPAT version, developed outside Excel.</td>\n<td>As before, regarding household pollution (not the focus of CPAT), no additional disaggregation is possible, to consider different exposure patterns among women, children and men. Regrettably we are already at the limit of Excel capabilities.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>The CPAT dashboard is user-friendly and is easy to navigate. It is unclear, however, where and how to update certain parameters should the need arise (e.g. changes in IER functions, or in VSL estimates) or to allow for country-specific inputs. To this end, a more detailed user manual would be extremely valuable to have.</td>\n<td>We hope that a few months of testing (with the team involved in each study) would give us a good idea of whether the tool can be roll out to other teams (and what type of training and support may be needed).</td>\n<td>Now we have produced a user’s guide, that intends to guide the user about policies configuration and parameters settings. This guide corresponds to Chapter 1 of CPAT documentation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>(Emissions – concentrations – health outcomes:</p>\n<p>Of course, and the team is keenly aware of this, CPAT has to rely on simplified ways of modelling the complex relationships (such as for example using intake fractions instead of using chemical transportation modelling of relating emissions to concentrations), but for a policy tool, this in my view is certainly more than good enough. That said, I wonder if in the future we can experiment with going beyond intake fractions</p></td>\n<td>Besides intake fractions, we have included other options to relate emissions and concentrations: i) TM5-FASST model, ii) Source apportionment information, in combination with TM5-FASST results and iii) Elastic Net and OLS model. We are also in the process of implementing in CPAT the results of a machine learning modeling to related emissions and concentrations, by emitting source type.</td>\n<td><p>In addition to the models indicated during the previous review, we have added the following models to relate emissions to concentration: i) a machine learning methodology (simplified) and ii) Average of intake fractions and source apportionment in combination with TM5-FASST.</p>\n<p>We have also expanded the source apportionment studies available in CPAT.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>I appreciate the effort made to show how CPAT’s figures correspond to IIASA’s, EDGAR’s and GBD’s, and think those are useful symmetries to show. That said, I do want to point out that this does not imply that the impact of a certain EFR on air pollution and health outcome would deliver the same results whether it’s impact is modelled with CPAT or the more complex models.  </td>\n<td>We have compared the air pollution module baseline estimates with external global sources, to make sure that we represent the baseline within the results from other more complex models. You are right that these checks do not guarantee that the policy impacts modeled in CPAT will be similar to the policy impacts obtained from other more complex models. Further checks will need to be performed in a policy/country-specific context and we have made sure that the tool allows the user to change assumptions and inputs, such the tool can be adjusted properly when needed.</td>\n<td>We added a section of “caveats” to the documentation that includes this point.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>I am currently looking at the relationships between air pollution and infant mortality, globally, as part of an ASA activity. We will be producing a concentration-response curve for this relationship, which you may choose to include into CPAT as an alternative to the GBD function.</td>\n<td>Sure, we can add this new concentration-response curve for infant mortality in CPAT.</td>\n<td><p>The paper is currently in the process of being published and the focus was on the impact of PM2.5 on increased pregnancy stunting (rather than infant mortality). This outcome can negatively affect children even after they recover from stunting.</p>\n<p>At this stage, we cannot include this effect in CPAT, but we already have children and neonatal health effects in the tool.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><p>The pollution model includes plenty of interesting information. The direct economic link is via the reduction in labor supply and deaths related to pollution. However, there are in effect two mechanisms at play - which could be added. The first is associated with the extensive margin - i.e. the number of employed individuals not going to work due to illness. The second is related to the intensive margin - the reduction in the number of productive hours worked. This is important in a country context where affected laborers tend to be low-skilled and where laborers can be drawn from an unemployed pool and put to work immediately (the case where employing the services of an unemployed worker to replace the affected worker is costless). If this is the case, then the direct pollution effect on labor could be negligible.</p>\n<p>However, if all workers are exposed to pollution, then what matters is the intensive margin - i.e. the work effort. Reducing pollution will have an extra benefit to society - increased labor effort and more efficient means of production regardless of the substitutability of labor.</p>\n<p>At the moment the CPAT tool describes the economic benefit or reducing pollution in terms of disability adjusted life years. This is an extensive margin concept where labor rotation rates are not accounted for (i.e. the probability of drawing an unskilled worker from the unemployment pool to replace the sick worker). Accounting for these rotation rates complicates the modeling but adds another element of realism. The economic cost will no longer be associated with DALY’s multiplied by income, but with DALY’s adjusted for labor replacement effects, multiplied by incomes.  </p></td>\n<td><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions. We agree that the “intensive margin” effect can be more relevant, due to a generalized drop in labor effort when workers are exposed to pollution. There is evidence that, besides working days lost and DALYs (both included in CPAT), productivity may decrease among workers that do attend to work. The drop in productivity has been studied in different working settings and locations of the world (see table below). We have not yet incorporated the results from the different studies into CPAT. The results of the last paper in the table (Fu, Viard, and Zhang 2017) could be implemented, if we believe that country specific results could be extrapolated and used in other countries.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is growing evidence on cognitive effects of air pollution in adults (Allen et al. 2017; Zhang, Chen, and Zhang 2018) and neurodevelopment issues children (WHO 2018), affecting human capital formation. This implies that air pollution has both short term and long-term effects in productivity, but so far, we have not been able to incorporate them in CPAT.</p></td>\n<td>As before, although the literature on productivity effects of pollution is growing, we still face the issue of location and setting specific studies, that cannot confidently be extrapolated to a global setting, for broad sectors of the economy.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>When cooking fuels are exempt, the spill-over effects on consumption of various fuels particularly biomass, and the resulting health (and other development) effects should be accounted for if possible.</td>\n<td>Thanks for this comment. Exactly, we allow the user to exempt, or rather rebate, cooking fuels in order to alleviate concerns of spill-over effects into increased biomass use. For the proportion of the consumption for which no exemption is chosen, at present we model explicit substitution into biofuels with carbon pricing (not modelled when these fuels are exempt). So, we are able to see the modelled differences in health effects between carbon price and non-carbon price (with and without exemptions).</td>\n<td>This point was clarified during the previous review</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nBelow is a list of the changes made in CPAT, between the 2021 review (in\nMarch) and August 2022.\n\n| Type          | Description
