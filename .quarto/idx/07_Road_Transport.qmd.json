In\nparticular, carbon taxes increase incentives to substitute away from\nprivate vehicles towards more fuel-efficient means of transport. As road\ntraffic has many externalities aside carbon emissions, carbon taxes may\nlead to a reduction in road transport-related externalities such as\ncongestion, accidents and road damage. To estimate the magnitude of\nthese co-benefits, the CPAT Road Transport Module quantifies the effect\nof a user-defined carbon tax or road fuel tax on (a) the intensity of\ncongestion as measured by the time lost relative to free-flowing\ntraffic, (b) the number of road fatalities, and (c) the maintenance cost\ndue to road damage.\n\nThe Road Transport Module is based on elasticities that we estimate\nusing an international country-year level dataset. This dataset is\ncompiled from many sources and describes road transport, as well as\ngeneral demographics and economic variables. The dataset covers the time\nfrom 1994 to 2021 and 186 countries, so that we can use within-country\nand between-country variation for identification. We estimate\nelasticities with respect to fuel prices and with respect to fuel taxes,\nas well as short and long-run elasticities. We estimate country-specific\nelasticities based on global coefficients and country-specific\ncovariates.\n\nThe magnitude of the resulting elasticities are broadly in line with the\nliterature: for a 10% fuel price increase from a carbon tax, total\nvehicle-km traveled decrease in the short run on average by 2.8 %;\ncongestion levels decrease by 3.4 %; accident fatalities decrease by 6.1\n%; and road damage decreases by 4.4 % in the long run.\n\nThe estimated elasticities are used within CPAT to produce policy\nforecasts of total vehicle-km traveled, congestion levels, accident\nfatalities and road damage cost. By choosing a country and inputting\ndifferent parameters for a policy in the dashboard, the user obtains a\nseries of graphs showing the time series with and without the policy, as\nwell as the policy impact defined by the difference of the two time\nseries.\n\nImportant caveats of the CPAT Road Transport Module include the assumed\nlinearity of effects, which may potentially not apply to large policy\nchanges. Moreover, econometrically estimated elasticities take the\nhistoric capital stock as given and do not predict the impact of\ndisruptive technological changes such as electric vehicles (EVs).\nFinally, CPAT does not measure the externality cost of non-realized\ntrips.\n\n## List of acronyms \n\nCCKP Climate Change Knowledge Portal (from the World Bank)\n\nFAD IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department\n\nGHO Global Health Observatory (from the World Health Organization)\n\nGIZ Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (German development\nagency)\n\nIEA International Energy Agency\n\nIMF International Monetary Fund\n\nNCEI National Centers for Environmental Information (United States)\n\nOECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nOLS Ordinary Least Squares (econometric estimation method)\n\nSDG Sustainable Development Goals\n\nSDR Sustainable Development Report (Sachs et al., 2019)\n\nUNECE United Nations Economic Commission for Europe\n\nVKT Vehicle-kilometers traveled (analogous to the US American\nvehicle-miles traveled)\n\nWDI World Development Indicators (from the World Bank)\n\nWGI World Governance Indicators (from the World Bank)\n\nWHO World Health Organization\n\nWRS World Road Statistics (from the International Road Federation)\n\nwrt “with respect to”\n\n## Introduction\n\nAside carbon emissions, road transport causes various externalities. The\nmost important transport externalities examined here are congestion,\nroad damage and accidents. These externalities are not the explicit\ntarget of carbon taxes, but also decline when the total distance\ntraveled declines. Such reductions in externalities occur as a “side\neffect” to the direct goal of a carbon tax and are commonly called\n*co-benefits* (I. Parry et al., 2014b).\n\nAs a tool for assessing the overall impact of carbon tax reforms across\nthe globe, CPAT predicts the magnitude of these co-benefits, among\nothers for the transport sector. The methodology relies on econometric\nestimations of long-run and short-run elasticities of externalities with\nrespect to fuel prices. The fuel price change induced by a carbon tax is\nthen multiplied by the elasticities to predict the transport co-benefits\nof the carbon tax policy.\n\nThe following sections will first give an overview over the relevant\nliterature; then present the data sources used and explain the\nmethodology for estimating the elasticities of externalities with\nrespect to fuel prices. In a next section, we will present the\nestimation results on three transport externalities: congestion, road\ndamage and accidents. Finally, we present the Excel implementation of\nthis work in CPAT.\n\n### Vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT)\n\nWe do not consider VKT (analogous to the US American vehicle-miles\ntraveled, VMT) a policy target *per se* but include it in order to\nillustrate one of the main channels through which fuel prices affect\ncongestion, road damage and accidents. Reductions in VKT may be a result\nof people transitioning to less transport-intensive activities, other\ntransport modes, in particular public/collective transport options,\ncloser workplaces and residence location choice (Molloy & Shan, 2013).\n\nIn particular, a carbon tax may incite passengers to travel together,\nsuch that a reduction of vehicle-km may be achieved *without* a\nreduction in passenger-trips, by increasing the rate of passengers per\nvehicle. Bento et al. (2013) show that the average number of users\nincreases with fuel prices, because users carpool (i.e. share a vehicle)\nmore. Carbon taxes may also deter detours, so that vehicle-km, and even\npassenger-km, may be reduced without a reduction in passenger-trips.\n\nFigure 7‑1 – Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and\nVKT\n\n![](./07/media/image1.png)\n\nNote: Channels (in orange boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic\ntheory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.\n\nThe negative relationship between fuel prices and VKT is well\nestablished in the economics literature. The literature provides a large\nnumber of empirical estimates of the elasticity of VKT wrt fuel prices.\nTable 7‑1 lists a selection of these estimates: most commonly, the\nestimates of VKT elasticity range from -0.05 to -0.50. A review paper\nfound the mean estimate to be -0.10 in the short run and -0.29 in the\nlong run (Goodwin et al., 2004).\n\nSome of these responses take time, so the long-run gasoline price\nelasticity of road deaths is likely to exceed the short-run elasticity.\nHowever, high fuel prices also push consumers to invest into more\nfuel-efficient vehicles, either buying cars that are more efficient or\nswitching from cars to motorcycles (or other modes). In this case, the\nliterature has extensively discussed the importance of the *rebound\neffect*, defined as efficiency induced consumption or, more plainly, the\nidea “buy a more fuel-efficient car, drive more” (Gillingham, Rapson, et\nal., 2015). The rebound effect might cause long-run VKT elasticity to be\n*lower* than short-run VKT elasticity.\n\nTable 7‑1 – Literature estimates of the elasticity of VKT wrt fuel\nprices\n\n| **Study**                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Country** | **Fuel price elasticity of road use** | **Note**      |                                                                                                              |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |             | **Short run**                         | **Long run**  |                                                                                                              |\n| **US**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |             |                                       |               |                                                                                                              |\n| Small & Van Dender (2007)                                                                                                                                                                                            | US          | \\-0.05                                | \\-0.22        | VKT elasticity.                                                                                              |\n| Burger & Kaffine (2009)                                                                                                                                                                                              | US          | \\-0.16                                |               | VKT elasticity during peak congestion hours in Los Angeles.                                                  |\n| Bento et al.

The costs of congestion occur in the form of excess travel time,\nincreased expected damage and injury from accidents among vehicles, and\nadditional vehicle operating costs for wear and fuel (Murphy & Delucchi,\n1997).\n\nThe relationship of total VKT to congestion is straightforward: the less\nvehicles on the road, the smaller the congestion problem (Sugiyama et\nal., 2008). This theoretical relationship has been documented in the\nliterature for decades (Johnson, 1964). When people share vehicles\n(carpooling) or substitute to public transport, the reduction in\ncongestion may be achieved with constant total passenger-km (Bento et\nal., 2013).\n\nFigure 7‑2 – Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and\ncongestion\n\n![](./07/media/image2.png)\n\nNote: Channels (in blue boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic\ntheory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.\n\nEmpirically, congestion has been difficult to measure until very\nrecently. Conventional measurement methods are costly, such as employing\nhumans to count, establishing cameras or installing wires on the road.\nThe resulting measurements only cover a limited number of precise\nlocations and often only short periods of time. More recently, the\ndevelopment of mobile communication technology has allowed newer\nmeasures such as the congestion indicators of Waze, Google Maps, Inrix\nand TomTom. These GPS-based data cover larger areas over long periods of\ntime and are highly disaggregated.\n\nGiven the limited/recent availability of congestion data, the empirical\nliterature on the impact of fuel prices on congestion levels is\nrelatively scarce. Burger & Kaffine (2009) find that a USD 1 increase in\nfuel prices reduces congestion and raises average freeway speeds by\napproximately 7% during rush-hour periods. They estimate short-run\nelasticity with a methodology similar to ours and find estimates ranging\nfrom -0.12 to -0.29. In an older study, C. A. Dahl (1979) finds an\nestimate of -0.35 for the elasticity of speed wrt fuel price. Cohen &\nRoth (2017) find that higher diesel prices lead to less but heavier\ntrucks on the road, thereby reducing congestion.\n\nBurke et al. (2017) examine the reaction to a fuel tax reform in\nIndonesia and find a fuel price elasticity of motor vehicle flows\n(number of vehicles on toll roads) between –0.1 and –0.2. They estimate\nthat Indonesia’s fuel subsidy reforms of 2013 and 2014 have reduced\ntraffic pressure by around 10%, relative to the counterfactual without\nreform.\n\nThe externality cost of congestion can be measured in monetary\nequivalent by multiplying time lost in traffic congestion by the value\nof travel time (Abrantes & Wardman, 2011).\n\n### Road accident fatalities\n\nRoad traffic injury is now the leading cause of death for children and\nyoung adults aged 5-29 years. It is the eighth leading cause of death\nfor all age groups surpassing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and diarrheal\ndiseases (World Health Organization, 2018c).\n\nRoad accidents are a function of factors including road user behavior,\nroad characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and the distances driven\n(vehicle-kilometers traveled, VKT) on roads by different types of\ndrivers. Research has also shown that economic variables affect road\naccident risk exposure. Among these, fuel prices and key macroeconomic\nmeasures such as the unemployment rate have been the focus of prior\nstudies rates (Ahangari et al., 2014; Gerdtham & Ruhm, 2006;\nInternational Transport Forum, 2015). The negative effect of fuel prices\non the risk of fatal accidents is well established in the literature.\n\nFor international comparisons, the literature considers data on\nfatalities more reliable than data on the number of accidents and number\nof injuries (Luoma & Sivak, 2007; Sauerzapf et al., 2010; World Health\nOrganization, 2013). This is why most studies concentrate on deadly\ncrashes, when trying to assess the relationship of fuel prices and road\naccidents. Chi et al. (2010) is a notable exception to this rule.\n\nThe relationship from fuel prices (and thus taxes) to accidents is\nmultifactorial, as shown in Chi, Porter, et al. (2013). Several aspects\nmay be summarized to a principal channel which is VKT. Reduced driving\ndecreases the exposure of both vehicle occupants and others to road\ncrashes.\n\nFigure 7‑3 – Schematic representation of the link between carbon tax and\naccidents, adapted from Chi, Porter et al. (2013)\n\n![](./07/media/image3.png)\n\nNote: Channels (in red boxes) are shown to illustrate the economic\ntheory; they are not modeled/estimated separately within CPAT.\n\nIn addition to reducing VKT, higher gasoline prices might also lead to a\nreduction in road deaths per kilometer driven. One reason is that, to\nconserve fuel, drivers might reduce high-speed driving and so-called\n“aggressive driving” (high rates of acceleration and braking). Another\nreason is that high-risk drivers, including the young, the old, and\nthose taking leisure-related trips, are particularly sensitive to\ngasoline prices (Morrisey & Grabowski, 2011; Sivak, 2009). Higher\ngasoline prices also result in substitution from heavier to lighter,\nmore fuel-efficient cars, which are associated with a lower overall\nnumber of road deaths per kilometer traveled (Gayer, 2004; White, 2004).\nSubstitution to bus travel may also reduce overall road safety risks.\n\nHowever, through other channels higher gasoline prices might actually\nlead to *more* rather than fewer road deaths. Higher gasoline prices\nreduce congestion and thereby increase average speed (Burger and Kaffine\n2009), which increases the risk of fatal crashes. Fuel price-induced\nsubstitution to motorcycles, which are more fuel-efficient, may also\ncause additional road deaths (Hyatt et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2009).\nIn particular, substitution to lighter cars and motorcycles would\nexplain why long-run elasticities of accidents wrt fuel prices would be\n*smaller* in absolute magnitude than short-run elasticities.\n\nMany studies in this field concentrate on the United States. Some\nauthors argue that the effect of higher gasoline prices on road deaths\noperates via a reduction in VKT (Grabowski & Morrisey, 2004), whereas\nothers report also a reduction in road deaths per VKT (Chi et al., 2010;\nChi, Quddus, et al., 2013; Grabowski & Morrisey, 2006; Haughton &\nSarkar, 1996; Montour, 2011; Sivak, 2009). Sivak (2009) explains this\nreduction by the disproportionate reduction in leisure driving (riskier\nthan commuter driving) and rural driving (more risky than urban\ndriving).\n\nLeigh & Wilkinson (1991) examine the relationship between gas price, gas\ntax, and road fatalities for all 50 states using a multiple regression\nframework. They find that a 1% increase in gas tax leads to a 0.18% to\n0.20% reduction in road fatalities, but that gas prices are not\nstatistically significant in explaining road fatalities. They use a\ndifferent method, using cent-per-gallon rather than a log-log\nspecification as does this study. A later study by Grabowski & Morrisey\n(2004), using 1983 to 2000 state-level data and a panel model to\ninvestigate the relationship between gas prices and road fatalities,\nfinds that a 1% increase in gasoline prices reduces road fatalities by\n0.23%. Looking only at Mississippi, Chi et al., (2010) finds a short-run\nelasticity of -0.25 and a long-run elasticity of -0.47. For Minnesota,\nChi, Quddus, et al. (2013) find an elasticity of -0.219 for fatal\ncrashes wrt to fuel prices and their estimates are higher in rural areas\nthan in urban areas.\n\nIn an international study, Burke & Nishitateno (2015) find a 1% increase\nin the gasoline pump price would reduce road fatalities by 0.3% to 0.6%.\nAround 35,000 road deaths per year could be avoided by the removal of\nglobal fuel subsidies. Litman (2012) presents a scatterplot for 16\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries\nthat shows a negative association between average gasoline prices and\ntraffic fatality rates. Using a panel model of 16 industrialized\ncountries, Ahangari et al. (2014) find an elasticity of -0.22 after\ncontrolling for VKT.\n\nOther country-specific short-term elasticity estimates include -0.2 to\n-0.3 for New Zealand (Best & Burke, 2019) and -0.2 for Australia (Burke\n& Teame, 2018).\n\nIn a dynamic urban model, Avner et al. (2014) examine the impact of\ncarbon taxes on urban mobility and underline the lock-in effect from\npublic transport investments: while the quality of urban transport\ninfrastructure is difficult to capture quantitatively, we include data\non satisfaction with public transport in our elasticity estimation to\naccount for this effect.\n\n### Road damage\n\nRoad damage depends strongly on road usage (Jacobson & Wågberg, 2005),\nbut not all vehicles affect road damage equally: wear and tear on the\npavement is a rapidly rising function of a vehicle’s axle weight\n(Jacobson & Wågberg, 2005; Murphy & Delucchi, 1997; Parker & Hussain Ph\nD, 2006; US FHWA, 2000). Estimations suggest that the pavement wear and\ntear of one average five-axle truck equates to approximately 4,000 cars\n(National Center for Freight & Infrastructure, 2014). Therefore, nearly\nall of the vehicle-caused road damage is attributable to heavy-duty\nvehicles (trucks).\n\nIn most countries around the world,[^7_1] light-duty vehicles (cars) use\ngasoline and trucks use diesel. Road damage is thus more dependent on\ndiesel price than on gasoline price.\n\nThe externality cost of road transport from pavement wear and tear has\nbeen discussed extensively in the economics literature, going back as\nfar as Adam Smith (Lindsey, 2006). There is a consensus that diesel is\nstrongly under-taxed, when comparing tax level to externality cost (I.\nW. H. Parry, 2008; Santos, 2017).\n\nMany authors have suggested addressing it directly through different\nforms of road pricing explicitly indexed on road damage cost (e.g.\nNewbery, 1988; Parker & Hussain Ph D, 2006; Santos et al., 2010). From\nan economist’s point of view, addressing the externality explicitly,\nwith taxes mirroring the externality cost directly, is the first best\nsolution. However, as a carbon tax also increases diesel prices, it\ndecreases truck VKT and thereby reduces road damage (Barla et al., 2014;\nWadud, 2016). In general, a carbon tax reduces all road transport\nexternalities that depend on VKT (Ekins, 1996).\n\nThe strength of this co-benefit depends on the elasticity of truck VKT\nwith respect to fuel prices/taxes. There is large evidence that trucks\nreduce their VKT when fuel prices rise. Let us cite just a few recent\nstudies finding significantly elastic VKT for trucks: Barla et al.\n(2014) find short and long-run price elasticities of -0.43 and -0.80\nrespectively; He (2015) estimates a VKT elasticity of -0.54; Ramli &\nGraham (2014) estimate short-run price elasticity between -0.11 and\n-0.16, long-run elasticity between -0.21 and -0.30 for trucks; Leard et\nal. (2015) find estimates around -0.20.\n\nSome studies find that the elasticity depends on the type of trucks:\nWadud (2016) finds that rigid trucks show statistically significant\nprice elasticity, but articulated trucks do not respond to changes in\nfuel prices.\n\nOn the opposite, some authors find that trucks are relatively inelastic\nwith regards to fuel prices (Winebrake et al., 2015). One study finds\nthat higher diesel prices are associated with fewer but heavier trucks,\nand therefore *more* road damage (Cohen & Roth, 2017).\n\nIn practice, two cost components to road damage may arise: the cost of\nrepairing the pavement damage, and the additional cost to users, which\nresult from traveling on damaged roadways. Given the difficulty to\nmeasure the second component, we concentrate on the first component in\nCPAT.\n\nMethodologically, it is important to note that some countries earmark\nrevenues from fuel taxes or road charges for road maintenance (Gultom et\nal., 2017). In these countries, our estimation technique is not valid\nbecause of endogeneity, so that we exclude them.\n\nQuantitatively, road damage may be considered the smallest of the three\ntransport externalities considered here.\n\n### Within-country heterogeneity (by socio-demographic characteristics)\n\nRegarding the within-country heterogeneity of the effect of fuel price\non VKT, the literature has not reached a consensus. Within countries,\nBastian & Börjesson (2014) find that urban populations, in particular\nthose with low incomes, respond stronger to fuel price increases and\neconomic downturn, i.e. are reducing car travel more. Similarly, many\nstudies find that (absolute) elasticity diminishes with higher income\nlevels (Santos & Catchesides, 2005; Small & Van Dender, 2007; West,\n2004). On the opposite, Wang & Chen (2014) find that higher income\nhouseholds show greater fuel price elasticity than lower income\nhouseholds.\n\nRegarding the effect of fuel prices on accident fatalities, the\nliterature suggest that the poor are more often victims of road\naccidents because of the vehicles they travel in. There is evidence that\nlarger vehicles (in particular light trucks and SUVs) cause more\nfatalities than light passenger vehicles, while drivers of SUVs are\nrelatively more protected: (White, 2004) calls this disequilibrium “the\n‘Arms race’ on American roads”. The highest risk is borne by\nmotorcyclists who tend to have lower incomes than four-wheeled vehicle\ndrivers (Hyatt et al., 2009). A particular group at high risk for road\ndeath are young drivers (aged 15–24) and their passengers. As these\ndrivers are more sensitive to fuel prices, the young drivers accident\nrate responds particularly strongly to fuel price increases (Morrisey &\nGrabowski, 2011). One of the few studies looking at gender and race, Chi\net al. (2010) find that fuel prices affect accident rates similarly for\nmen and women, as well as for white and black population.\n\n### Between-country heterogeneity\n\nRegarding the between-country heterogeneity of the effect of fuel prices\non VKT, most estimates concentrate on developed countries, in particular\nthe USA. Studies on developing countries often face data challenges, but\nso far the literature suggests that the elasticities lay within the same\norder of magnitude in developed and developing countries (Gillingham,\nRapson, et al., 2015).\n\nRegarding the effect of fuel prices on accident fatalities, some studies\nlook at differences between high- and low-income countries, but the\nliterature on within-country determinants of road fatalities and their\nelasticity wrt to fuel prices is scarce. Data is notoriously more scarce\nin developing countries. Country-level panel data identification\nstrategies such as used in Burke & Nishitateno (2015) typically yield\none elasticity for all countries. A priori, the effect is unclear:\nwealthier individuals travel larger distances and thus have a higher\nrisk of traffic accidents, but poorer individuals travel more on foot\nand on motorcycles, which increases their risk to die from a road\naccident.\n\n### Fuel prices vs. taxes\n\nMost of the above mentioned literature examines the effect of fuel\nprices on the various outcomes discussed. However, for CPAT we are\ninterested in the effect of a carbon tax.\n\nRegarding the effect on VKT, S. Li et al. (2014) show that gasoline\nconsumption responds more strongly to gasoline taxes than to gasoline\nprices. They explain that consumers may respond more to taxes than\nequal-sized changes in tax-inclusive gasoline prices because of\nperceived persistence and salience. Variation in gasoline taxes also is\ncovered much more intensively in the media.\n\nRegarding road fatalities, Leigh & Wilkinson (1991) show that gasoline\ntaxes have a significant effect on fatalities while the effect of price\neffect from oil market fluctuations is not significant. However, these\nfindings are on a cents-per-liter basis rather than a percent basis, so\nthey are not directly comparable to our results.\n\n### Methodology\n\nLiterature generally finds that the short-term elasticity of fuel use is\nweaker than the long-term elasticity wrt fuel prices (Chi et al., 2010).\nUsually, researchers explain this finding by structural adjustments to\nthe vehicle fleet, travel demand (work and residence locations) and\ninfrastructure. Hence, there has been some methodological effort to\nestimate short-run and long-run elasticities separately.\n\nThe methodology for elasticity estimation in the Road Transport Module\nis similar to Burke & Nishitateno (2015). Using country-year-level data,\nthe main estimations are fixed effects and between estimators of a\nlinear log-log equation. The between estimator uses average data for\neach country and provides estimates of long-run effects (Baltagi, 2008;\nBaltagi & Griffin, 1984; Pesaran & Smith, 1995; Pirotte, 1999; Stern,\n2010). Fixed-effects estimations control for time-invariant factors such\nas the extent of mountainous terrain, but when a static fixed-effects\nequation is estimated the coefficients represent short-run effects. This\nmethod has been widely used in the literature looking at the effect of\nfuel prices on road safety (Best & Burke, 2019; Burke & Nishitateno,\n2015; Grabowski & Morrisey, 2006; Montour, 2011). An alternative way of\nestimating long-run elasticities is the distributed lag specification\n(Burke & Nishitateno, 2015; Chi, Porter, et al., 2013; Montour, 2011).\n\nOther studies, e.g. Chi, Quddus, et al. (2013), use more time-series\nrelated methods, in particular testing for unit roots and accounting for\nstationarity. These methods are difficult to implement with unbalanced\npanels, as in our case. However, in his standard econometrics textbook\n(Baltagi, 2008; Baltagi & Griffin, 1984) considers that time-series\nmethods should apply when T (the number of periods) is large and N (the\nnumber of countries) is small, whereas panel data methods like the\nbetween estimator are appropriate when T small and N large: “Using panel\ndata, one can avoid the problem of spurious regression$…$. Unlike the\nsingle time series spurious regression literature, the panel data\nspurious regression estimates give a consistent estimate of the true\nvalue of the parameter as both N and T tend to $\\infty$. This is\nbecause, the panel estimator averages across individuals and the\ninformation in the independent cross-section data in the panel leads to\na stronger overall signal than the pure time series case.”\n\n## Data sources\n\n### General\n\nWe use a panel dataset of country-year-level data, including as many\ncountries and years as available, resulting in an unbalanced panel. The\ndataset covers the time from 1994 to 2021 and 186 countries around the\nworld.\n\nThe main data source are the World Road Statistics (WRS), regularly\npublished by the International Road Foundation (International Road\nFederation, 2018b). We use data from its editions 2001 to 2021, covering\nthe years 1995 to 2019.\n\nAside many of our covariates, WRS also contains two of our outcomes of\ninterest: we use total distance driven in vehicle-kilometers traveled\n(VKT) and road damage, as measured by infrastructure maintenance\ninvestment.\n\nGeneral demographic and macroeconomic variables are provided by the\nWorld Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database.[^7_2] The World\nBank’s World Governance Indicators (WGI) database[^7_3] gives indicator\nmeasures of corruption and rule of law.\n\nThe online database for Sustainable Development Report (SDR) 2019[^7_4]\n(Sachs et al., 2019) gives an indicator of the quality of public\ntransport.\n\nWeather information at the country-year level is provided by the\nClimatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia,\ndownloadable via the World Bank’s Climate Change Knowledge Portal\n(CCKP).[^7_5] We use the precipitation (in mm), the minimum temperature\n(in °C), the number of hot days (Tmax\\>40°C), and the number of ice days\n(Tmax\\<0°C).\n\nAll monetary variables are deflated to 2018 USD using the World Bank’s\nUS GDP deflator and adjusted for purchasing power parity (WDI).\n\nAn exhaustive list of variables with their sources can be found in the\nAppendix (page 7-43).\n\n### Congestion\n\nTraffic congestion is measured using the TomTom Traffic Index. This\nindex covers over 400 cities across 61 countries. The TomTom Traffic\nindex statistics are calculated from anonymized GPS data collected via\nnavigation devices, in-dashboard systems and smartphones.\n\nThe congestion level percentages represent the measured amount of extra\ntravel time experienced by drivers across the entire year. As a first\nstep, TomTom establishes a baseline of travel times during uncongested,\nfree flow conditions across each road segment in each city. They then\nanalyze travel times across the entire year for each city. The TomTom\nTraffic Index then represents the difference between observed travel\ntimes and free flow travel time.\n\nFor example, an overall congestion level of 36% means that the extra\ntravel time is 36% more than an average trip would take during\nuncongested conditions. Average times are of actual taken trips, across\nevery vehicle in the entire network, 24/7. Travel times in free-flow\n(uncongested) conditions are not based on legal speed limits but on\nactual trips made.\n\nThe TomTom Traffic Index is available both overall, as well as for\nspecific weekdays and peak times, including morning and evening peak\nhours.\n\n### Road safety\n\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)[^7_6] and the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)[^7_7]\nprovide statistical databases, used to complete missing data points in\nthe WRS, in particular for accident fatalities.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) publishes reports on Road Safety. We\nuse the 2013 edition with data on 2011 (World Health Organization, 2013)\nand the 2018 edition with data on 2017 (World Health Organization,\n2018c), which include detailed covariates on the legal framework of\ntraffic, such as seat belt wearing rate, blood alcohol concentration\nlimit, helmet enforcement and others.[^7_8]\n\nFor Côte d’Ivoire and Mexico, country-specific projects made more\ndetailed accident data available, which are included in the general CPAT\nanalysis. Missing data for Côte d’Ivoire in WRS are completed using the\nnational accident statistics provided by the Ivorian Ministry of\nTransport. Unrealistically low accident numbers for Mexico in WRS are\nreplaced by data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and\nGeography (INEGI) and the Mexican Transport Institute (IMT).\n\n### Fuel prices\n\nFuel prices are taken from the fuel price database of the overall CPAT\nproject. For road fuels, the sources used are the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs\nDepartment (FAD), Enerdata’s Global Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> Data,\nIEA’s Data and statistics and GIZ’s Sustainable Urban Transport\nProject.\n\nIn combining these different data sources, the following order of steps\nis applied:\n\n1.  If Enerdata, IEA and IMF data is available, we establish a weighted\n    average of price data in Enerdata (60%), IEA (10%) and IMF (30%);\n\n2.  if IMF or IEA are missing, we use Enerdata;\n\n3.  If Enerdata is missing, we use the information in the IMF database;\n\n4.  If IMF is missing, we use the information in the IEA database;\n\n5.  If IEA is missing, we use the information in the GIZ database.\n\nAside the final retail price at the pump, we use data on taxes\nsummarizing VAT, existing carbon taxes, excise tax and others. We use\nthe same algorithm as described above for prices to construct time\nseries of fuel taxes. Supply cost is defined as the difference of price\nat the pump minus taxes.\n\n### Externality costs\n\nThe benefits of prevented mortalities can be expressed in terms of a\n“Value of a Statistical Life” (VSL), which represents the value a\ngiven population places *ex ante* on avoiding the death of an\nunidentified individual. VSL is based on the sum of money each\nindividual is prepared to pay for a given reduction in the risk of\npremature death, for example from diseases linked to air pollution\n(OECD, 2012).\n\nThe country-specific VSL in CPAT is adapted from OECD (2012), adjusted\nfor GDP growth and inflation (within the Air Pollution Module).\n\nWe compute the average speed from TomTom’s total VKT and total travel\ntime. We then compute the VKT per capita from WRS’ national VKT divided\nby the population size from the WB’s World Development Indicators (WDI).\nThis average VKT per capita is multiplied by the size of urban\npopulation over 15 year of age (WDI) and divided by the average speed,\nyielding total urban travel time.\n\nThe total urban travel time is then multiplied by 80% of the average\nhourly after-tax wages (from Air Pollution Module), yielding the value\nof travel time.\n\n### Data cleaning\n\nSeveral variables result of the combination of several data sources. For\nexample, we combine information on accident fatalities from WRS, OECD\nand UNECE. In these cases, we define a clear order and only “fill up”\nmissing variables with the second and third source.\n\nAfter establishing this mix of data sources, a visual control of\ncountry-specific time series is performed to identify outliers. For each\nvisually identified outlier, we perform thorough background checks and\nin case of doubt only keep one source (resulting in some limited data\nloss).\n\nStock variables such as length of road network, country area or size of\npopulation are interpolated linearly when missing between years with\nnon-missing data for that country. However, we do not extrapolate beyond\nthe last/first year with non-missing data. The variable table in the\nAppendix (page 7-43) indicates for which variables such interpolation is\nperformed.\n\n## Methods for elasticity estimation\n\nThis chapter explains the general methodology for estimating short- and\nlong-run elasticities and making them country-specific in a\ndata-parsimonious way. This methodology is then applied to VKT and the\nthree outcomes of interest: congestion, road damage and fatalities from\nroad accidents.\n\n### Estimation equation\n\nWe regress the logarithm of the outcome variable onto a constant, the\nlogarithm of fuel prices, a list of covariates and fixed effects. The\ngeneral form of the estimated regression estimation is\n\n|  |                                                                                                                                                         |     |\n|  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n|  | $\\ln\\left( Y_{\\text{ct}} \\right) = \\alpha + \\beta\\ln\\left( p_{\\text{ct}} \\right) + \\gamma\\ X_{\\text{ct}} + \\mu_{t} + \\mu_{c} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}$, | (1) |\n\nwhere $\\ln\\left( Y_{\\text{ct}} \\right)$ is the natural logarithm of\nthe outcome in country $c$ in year $t$, $\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})}$ is\nthe natural logarithm of pump price for gasoline, $X_{\\text{ct}}$ is a\nvector of covariates including income per capita and population density,\nand $\\mu_{c}$ and $\\mu_{t}$ are country- and year-specific effects.\n\nAn elasticity measures how much an outcome changes relatively to its\ninitial value (e.g. in percent) when another variable, here the pump\nprice of gasoline, changes (in percent). As we are using the log-log\nspecification, the coefficient estimate $\\widehat{\\beta}$ in equation\n(1) is an estimate of the elasticity of the outcome $Y_{\\text{ct}}$\nwith respect to (wrt) fuel prices $p_{\\text{ct}}$.\n\n### Short-run and long-run estimators\n\nFollowing (Burke & Nishitateno, 2015), we consider that the within\nestimator from a static fixed-effects equation represents shorter-run\neffects, and the between estimator provides estimates of long-run\neffects (Baltagi, 2008; Baltagi & Griffin, 1984; Pesaran & Smith, 1995;\nPirotte, 1999; Stern, 2010).[^7_9]\n\nFor simplicity, let us reduce the notation of the previous equation (1)\nto:\n\n|  |                                                                                    |     |\n|  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n|  | $y_{\\text{ct}} = \\alpha + \\beta x_{\\text{ct}} + \\mu_{c} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}$, | (2) |\n\nwhere the logarithms have been omitted and all righthand-side variables\nsummarized under the vector $x_{\\text{ct}}$.\n\nThe interpretation for the long and short run is based on the idea that\nthe previous equation (2) may alternatively be formulated:\n\n|  |                                                                                                                                       |     |\n|  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n|  | $y_{\\text{ct}} = \\alpha + \\beta'{\\overline{x}}_{c} + \\beta''(x_{\\text{ct}} - {\\overline{x}}_{c}) + \\mu_{c} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}$, | (3) |\n\nwhere ${\\overline{x}}_{c}$ is the average of $x_{\\text{ct}}$ over\ntime: ${\\overline{x}}_{c} = \\sum_{t}^{}{x_{\\text{ct}}/T_{c}}$, where\n$T_{c}$ is the number of years included for country $c$ in the\nregression.\n\nIn the model described by equation (3), we postulate that changes in the\naverage value of $x_{\\text{ct}}$ for an individual country may have a\ndifferent effect from temporary departures from the average. The model\nallows a different response to permanent rather than transitory changes.\nIf $\\beta' = \\beta''$, then the model in (3) collapses into the\nprevious model in (2).\n\nWhatever the properties of $\\mu_{c}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}$, if\nequation (2) is true, we can take the averages and find that:\n\n|  |                                                                                                   |     |\n|  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n|  | ${\\overline{y}}_{c} = \\alpha + \\beta'{\\overline{x}}_{c} + \\mu_{c} + {\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c}$, | (4) |\n\nwhere ${\\overline{y}}_{c}$ is the average of $y_{\\text{ct}}$ over\ntime: ${\\overline{y}}_{c} = \\sum_{t}^{}{y_{\\text{ct}}/T_{c}}$ and\n${\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c}$ is the average of the error term:\n${\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c} = \\sum_{t}^{}{\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}/T_{c}}$.\n\nSubtracting (4) from (3), it must also be true that:\n\n|  |                                                                                                                                            |     |\n|  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |\n|  | ${y_{\\text{ct}} - \\overline{y}}_{c} = \\beta''{(x_{\\text{ct}} - \\overline{x}}_{c}) + (\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}} - {\\overline{\\epsilon}}_{c})$. | (5) |\n\nThese equations are known from panel econometrics textbooks: equation\n(4) describes the between estimator and equation (5) describes the\nwithin estimator, also known as fixed-effects estimator.\n\nFixed-effects estimations control for time-invariant characteristics of\ncountries such as the extent of size or mountainous terrain. As\nillustrated in equation (5), the identifying variation comes from\nwithin-country deviations from the country-mean. Given standard\nassumptions on the error term $\\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}$ (mean$\\ 0$,\nuncorrelated with itself, uncorrelated with $x_{\\text{ct}}$,\nuncorrelated with $\\mu_{c}$, and homoscedastic), the within estimator\ncan be estimated as an OLS on (5) or, equivalently, an OLS on equation\n(1) including country dummy variables. For this study, this equation is\nestimated using the Stata command *xtreg, fe*.\n\nThe between estimator is given by the OLS estimator on equation (4).\nThis specification cancels out time-differences. The between estimates\nare based on cross-sectional country differences. Individual-invariant\nregressors such as time dummies cannot be identified. For this project,\nthis equation is estimated using the Stata command *xtreg, be*.[^7_10]\n\n### Covariates\n\nThe choice of the variables used as covariates $X_{\\text{ct}}$ follows\nthe list of variables used in World Health Organization (2018c). A\ndetailed list can be found in the Appendix (page 7-43).\n\n### Country-specific elasticity estimates\n\nThe effect of fuel prices on our three outcomes of interest is likely to\nbe heterogeneous across different countries. However, there is limited\ndata available for most countries, so that unparametrically\ncountry-specific estimations proved not feasible. We discard to option\nto create *ad hoc* regional groups and estimate group-specific\nelasticities, as we want a more data-driven methodology. To strike a\nbalance between accounting for heterogeneity and using available data\nparsimoniously, we estimate elasticities that are linear expressions of\nseveral covariates.\n\nThe estimation includes interaction terms between fuel prices and the\nadditional variables. For example, if elasticity depends on two more\nvariables, the estimation equation is:\n\n|  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |\n|  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n|  | $\\ln\\left( Y_{\\text{ct}} \\right) = \\alpha + \\beta_{0}\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})} + \\beta_{1}v_{\\text{ct}}^{1}\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})} + \\beta_{2}v_{\\text{ct}}^{2}\\ln{(p_{\\text{ct}})} + \\gamma\\ X_{\\text{ct}} + \\mu_{c} + \\ \\mu_{t} + \\epsilon_{\\text{ct}}$, | (6) |\n\nwhere the variables are the same as before, and$\\ v_{\\text{ct}}^{1}$\nis the first additional variable influencing elasticity and\n$v_{\\text{ct}}^{2}$ is the second additional variable influencing\nelasticity. The “country-specific” elasticity estimated is then:\n\n|  |                                                                                                                                            |     |\n|  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |\n|  | ${\\widehat{\\beta}}_{c} = {\\widehat{\\beta}}_{0} + {\\widehat{\\beta}}_{1}\\overline{v_{c}^{1}} + {\\widehat{\\beta}}_{2}\\overline{v_{c}^{2}}$, | (7) |\n\nwhere $\\overline{v_{c}^{1}}$ is the average across recent years[^7_11]\nof variable $v_{\\text{ct}}^{1}$ for country $c$ (and analogously for\nvariable $\\overline{v_{c}^{2}}$). In practice, we include not two but\nfive additional variables $v_{\\text{ct}}^{k}$, which we omit here for\nreadability.\n\nWe consider 15 candidate variables linked to traffic conditions,\ndemographics and availability of substitutes to private vehicles. The\nfinal estimations include only the variables found to be empirically\nmost important.\n\nThe selection of covariates $v_{\\text{ct}}^{k}$ included in the\nexpressions of elasticities is data-driven using a lasso regression as\nimplemented in Stata command *lasso2* (Ahrens et al., 2020). The lasso\nprocedure penalizes additional variables/parameters and thereby\nencourages simple, sparse models, i.e. models with fewer parameters. The\nalgorithm sequentially includes one variable after the other, in an\noptimized order. The order in which predictors are entered into the\nmodel can be interpreted as an indication of the relative predictive\npower of each predictor.\n\n### Fuel prices or taxes\n\nWe are interested in the effect of carbon taxes on accidents. The most\nclassical way of estimating tax impact consists in estimating price\nelasticity from exogenous price variation. However, some of the\nliterature states that consumers might not react identically to price\nchanges and to tax changes (salience, anticipation of persistence over\ntime).\n\nTherefore, we estimate two sets of elasticities: elasticities with\nrespect to (wrt) fuel prices and wrt fuel taxes. The estimation for\nelasticity wrt to prices follows the equations above. The estimations\nfor elasticity wrt to taxes include the natural logarithms of both\ntax-exclusive prices and taxes as two separate variables. The elasticity\nof interest is then the estimated coefficient of the tax variable. Fuel\ntax data is only available for a limited amount of countries.\n\n## Elasticity results\n\nFor readability, this note includes shortened results tables. For the\nfull results, please refer to the *Tran\\_Elas* sheet of CPAT.\n\n### Congestion\n\nFigure 7‑4 shows descriptive evidence of the relationship between urban\ncongestion and gasoline prices: across countries, there is a significant\nnegative correlation in 2018.[^7_12] Congestion is measured with the\nTomTom Traffic Index, indicating the additional time spent in congested\ntraffic as compared to free-flowing traffic (in percent, see Section\n7.4.2 for more details).\n\nThis simple descriptive evidence omits many variables. In particular,\nthe elasticity of demand of private vehicle trips depends on the\navailability of (and practicability) alternative means of transport.\nMoreover the resulting congestion depends on whether these alternative\nmeans of transport will also be on the road (e.g. buses) or elsewhere\n(e.g. trains).\n\nFigure 7‑4 – Scatter plot and linear regression of urban congestion as a\nfunction of gasoline prices in 2020\n\n<span class=\"chart\">$CHART$</span>\n\nSource: Tomtom, Enerdata, EIU, IEA, own computations.\n\n#### Short-run elasticity\n\nThis section shows the results for the short-run estimations of\ncongestion on fuel prices and a list of covariates. The most relevant\nspecification i the within estimator of equation (1), as specified in\nequation (5).\n\nFor simplicity, we only show the regression results for overall\ncongestion, whereas CPAT also contains estimates for weekday congestion\nand weekday peak time congestion. The results on these three indicators\nare similar, but the effect on peak congestion is typically slightly\nstronger.\n\nTable 7‑2 – Regression results short-run congestion\n\n| **Urban congestion**

For each estimator, we compute the coefficient\nfirst without and then with covariates included. All of the estimates\nlie within a similar order of magnitude: the short-run elasticity of\ncongestion wrt fuel price is estimated between -0.08 and -0.29. This is\nvery close to the estimates ranging from -0.12 to -0.29 in (Burger &\nKaffine, 2009) and more inelastic than the estimate of -0.35 in (C. A.\nDahl, 1979).\n\nThe columns 4 and 6 show the results of including additional interaction\nterms between the fuel price and selected variables. The coefficient of\nthe fuel price is not directly interpretable in this specification. In\norder to obtain country-specific elasticity estimates, one needs to\nmultiply the coefficients with the country-specific values of the\ncovariates. The results are given below in Section 7.6.1.3.\n\n#### Long-run elasticity\n\nComputing the between estimator of equation (1), given by equation (4),\nwe obtain the long-run elasticity.\n\nTable 7‑3

The third column shows the\nresults of including the interaction of fuel price with the empirically\nrelevant covariates, which are not directly interpretable and will be\ndiscussed in the next subsection.\n\n#### Country-specific elasticities\n\nTable 7‑2 and Table 7‑3 show the results of regressing congestion on\nfuel prices and covariates, estimating the short-run (within estimator)\nand long-run (between estimator) elasticities. The parameters of the\nlast column of each table give the results of including interaction\nterms with relevant covariates, as described by equation (6). The most\nrelevant interaction terms are chosen using lasso regressions (see\nSection 7.3.8 for methodology).\n\nWhile using fuel price data for estimating elasticity is standard in the\nliterature, some authors have suggested that consumers react more\nstrongly to changes in fuel taxes than to (equivalent) changes in fuel\nprices. This hypothesis typically relies on additional salience of\ntaxes, which are often strongly featured in the media, and on\nexpectations about the persistence of the price change into the future.\n\nTherefore, we repeat the same estimations of Table 7‑2 and Table 7‑3\nusing fuel supply cost and fuel taxes as two separate variables, rather\nthan overall fuel price at the pump. Detailed results are omitted here,\nbut can be found in the MS Excel file appendix to this report.\n\nAs a result, we have four elasticity estimates for each country:\nshort-run and long-run, each wrt prices and wrt taxes.\n\nTable 7‑4 shows the lists of variables which are selected by the lasso\nregression algorithm as the five most relevant covariates for fuel price\nelasticity of congestion. The elasticities depend on characteristics of\nthe vehicle fleet (number of vehicles per capita, share of motorcycles),\non characteristics of the road network (density, speed limits),\ncharacteristics of transport substitutes (satisfaction with public\ntransport) and on more general features of society (population size,\nrule of law indicator, urbanization, share of young people, and others).\n\nTable 7‑4 – Variables selected for country-specific congestion\nelasticity estimation\n\n| **Short run**                                                                                                                                                       | **Long run**                           |                                               |                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| **wrt price**                                                                                                                                                       | **wrt tax**                            | **wrt price**                                 | **wrt tax**                                   |\n| Ln of number of vehicles per capita                                                                                                                                 | Number of vehicles per capita          | Maximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)        | Maximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)        |\n| Satisfaction with public transport (%)                                                                                                                              | Satisfaction with public transport (%) | Ln of population                              | Ln of population                              |\n| Share of paved roads (in %)                                                                                                                                         | Share of urban population (in %)       | Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) | Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) |\n| Ln of population                                                                                                                                                    | Seat-belt wearing rate (%)             | Seat-belt wearing rate (%)                    | Satisfaction with public transport (%)        |\n| Precipitation (in mm)                                                                                                                                               | Maximum speed on urban roads (in km/h) | Precipitation (in mm)                         | Road density (in km per km2)                  |\n| The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables. |                                        |                                               |                                               |\n\nGiven the large number of countries and variants, the elasticities are\nnot reproduced here.

The third column cannot\nbe directly interepreted and is discussed in the following subsection.\n\n#### Country-specific elasticities\n\nTable 7‑8 shows the lists of variables which are selected by the lasso\nregression algorithm as the five most relevant covariates for the\nelasticity of accident fatalities, chosen by a data-driven algorithm.\nAgain, the elasticities depend on characteristics of the vehicle fleet,\non characteristics of the road network and on more general features of\nsociety. In particular, motorcyclist are known to be at particularly\nhigh risk for accident injury and death. Classical road safety features\nsuch as seat-belt wearing rate, alcohol consumption and maximum speed\nallowed also play a role. More broadly, GDP and infant mortality rate\ncapture the general development situation of the country, as well as the\nquality of the country’s health system.\n\nTable 7‑8 – Variables selected for country-specific accident elasticity\nestimation\n\n| **Short run**                                                                                                                                                       | **Long run**                                  |                                                                            |                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **wrt price**                                                                                                                                                       | **wrt tax**                                   | **wrt price**                                                              | **wrt tax**                                                                |\n| Number of vehicles per capita                                                                                                                                       | Ln of number of vehicles per capita           | GDP per capita (in 2018 PPP-adj USD)                                       | GDP per capita (in 2018 PPP-adj USD)                                       |\n| Population share of 15 to 24 years-old (in %)                                                                                                                       | Population share of 15 to 24 years-old (in %) | Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol) | Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol) |\n| Satisfaction with public transport (%)                                                                                                                              | Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) | Share of urban population (in %)                                           | Share of urban population (in %)                                           |\n| Road density (in km per km2)                                                                                                                                        | Number of motorcycles per capita              | Ln of number of vehicles per capita                                        | Number of motorcycles per capita                                           |\n| Seat-belt wearing rate (%)                                                                                                                                          | Maximum speed on rural roads (in km/h)        | Number of motorcycles per capita                                           | Maximum speed on rural roads (in km/h)                                     |\n| The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables. |                                               |                                                                            |                                                                            |\n\nFigure 7‑7 shows the distribution of country-specific accident\nelasticity estimates.

The underlying hypothesis is that\nall road damage is repaired and therefore captured by the road\nmaintenance budget of the government, as opposed to road investment for\nthe expansion of the road network.\n\nCompared to the other two outcomes previously discussed, road damage\npresents the particularity to be more dependent on diesel price than on\nfuel price. Although the differential impact of a carbon tax on fuel and\ngasoline prices is relatively small, we thus use diesel prices in this\nsection rather than gasoline prices as before.\n\n#### Short-run elasticity\n\nThe results of road damage in the short run are not significant. They\nare included in the MS Excel appendix to this report, but within CPAT we\nassume the short run elasticity of road damage wrt fuel prices to be\nzero.\n\n#### Long-run elasticity\n\nIn the long run, road damage costs react to diesel prices, but the\nresults are not statistically significant as shown on Table 7‑10. In the\nsimple specifications (columns 1 and 2), the elasticity is around -0.3.\nWe use the parameters estimated in the specification including\ninteraction terms (column 3) in order to compute the country-specific\nelasticities for CPAT presented in the next subsection.\n\nTable 7‑10 – Regression results long-run road damage costs\n\n| **Road damage**

Sample averages are subtracted from the interaction variables prior to interacting with the fuel price. |                       |             |               |\n\n#### Country-specific elasticities\n\nAs shown on Table 7‑11, the long-run road damage elasticities depend on\nstructural features of the country’s transportation system (population\ndensity, total road network, urbanization), on the vehicle fleet,\nparticularly larger vehicles, and rule of law. Additionally, weather\nplays an important role for road damage. In particular, minimum\ntemperatures seem to impact the effect of a carbon tax: with less\ntraffic, the effect of low temperatures (frost) on road damage is\nreduced.\n\nTable 7‑11 – Variables selected for country-specific road damage\nelasticity estimation\n\n| **Long run**                                                                                                                                                        |                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| **wrt price**                                                                                                                                                       | **wrt tax**                                         |\n| Number of lorries and vans                                                                                                                                          | Number of lorries and vans                          |\n| Total length of road network (in km)                                                                                                                                | Total length of road network (in km)                |\n| Share of urban population (in %)                                                                                                                                    | Share of urban population (in %)                    |\n| Share of paved roads (in %)                                                                                                                                         | Road density (in km per km2)                        |\n| Minimum of daily min-temperature (in °C)                                                                                                                            | Population density (people per sq. km of land area) |\n| The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables. |                                                     |\n\nFigure 7‑8 shows that the estimates using fuel taxes suggest less\nelasticity of road prices wrt fuel taxes than the estimates using prices\nat the pump.

We do not consider VKT a policy outcome per\nse and the effect of fuel prices on the other outcomes is calculated\ndirectly (not via the VKT elasticities).\n\n#### Short-run elasticity\n\nThe estimated short-run elasticities of VKT wrt fuel price are shown\nTable 7‑13. The short-run elasticity is estimated at -0.395, which is\nsimilar to the more elastic estimates in the literature (Table 7‑1).\n\nTable 7‑13 – Regression results short-run VKT\n\n| **VKT**

We\nsee that the road network (total length of the network, road density),\nthe fleet (motorcycles, number of vehicles) and more general country\ncharacteristics (population size and density, infant mortality rate,\nGDP) enter into the calculation.\n\nTable 7‑15 – Variables selected for country-specific VKT elasticity\nestimation\n\n| **Short run**                                                                                                                                                       | **Long run**                                        |                                                     |                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| **wrt price**                                                                                                                                                       | **wrt tax**                                         | **wrt price**                                       | **wrt tax**                            |\n| Ln of number of vehicles per capita                                                                                                                                 | Number of vehicles per capita                       | Total length of road network (in km)                | Total length of road network (in km)   |\n| Number of motorcycles per capita                                                                                                                                    | Number of motorcycles per capita                    | Maximum speed on rural roads (in km/h)              | Maximum speed on rural roads (in km/h) |\n| Ln of population                                                                                                                                                    | Population density (people per sq. km of land area) | Number of motorcycles per capita                    | Number of motorcycles per capita       |\n| Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)                                                                                                                       | Road density (in km per km2)                        | Rule of law (from -2.5=low to 2.5=high)             | GDP per capita (in 2018 PPP-adj USD)   |\n| Maximum speed on urban roads (in km/h)                                                                                                                              | Precipitation (in mm)                               | Population density (people per sq. km of land area) | Road density (in km per km2)           |\n| The covariates used for estimating the country-specific elasticities are chosen by a data-driven machine learning algorithm among a list of 30 candidate variables. |                                                     |                                                     |                                        |\n\nFigure 7‑9 – Country-specific VKT elasticities, graphical overview\n\n![](./07/media/image7.png)\n\nThe distribution of the resulting country-specific elasticity estimates\nis described in Figure 7‑9 and Table 7‑16.

The module\nthen computes changes in VKT, congestion, accidents and road damage and\npresents them graphically in the dashboard tab. The information flow is\nschematized in Figure 7‑9. Although the effect on VKT is computed, the\nother outcomes are modeled directly as a function of price, in order to\navoid having to take functional form assumptions on the influence of VKT\nand its interaction with the other channels.\n\nFigure 7‑9 – Input and output of CPAT's Road Transport Module\n\n![](./07/media/image8.png)\n\nNote: Channels are shown to illustrate the economic theory; they are not\nmodeled/estimated separately within CPAT. The estimated elasticities\nresult of the interaction of all channels in the data.\n\n### Baseline forecasts\n\nIn order to graphically represent changes induced by the policy compared\nto a baseline, we must first establish a baseline forecast. The\nmethodology in CPAT is identical for all three outcomes and VKT. It\nfollows the following structure:\n\n  - Establish a linear forecast based on the average growth rate of\n    available (often incomplete) time series of the variable in the\n    past;\n    \n      - The sheet “Tran\\_Data” contains recent values of the outcome\n        variables as well as the geometric average of growth rates over\n        the past years.\n\n  - Adjust the variable’s linear forecast:\n    \n      - for (forecasted) future deviations from (observed) average past\n        GDP growth using the estimated elasticity of the outcome wrt\n        GDP,\n    \n      - for (forecasted) future deviations from (observed) average past\n        population growth using the estimated elasticity of the outcome\n        wrt population.\n\n> $Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{GDP}_{t}}{\\text{GDP}_{t - 1}} - \\overline{g^{\\text{GDP}}} \\right)^{\\eta_{\\text{GDP}}}{\\left( \\frac{\\text{pop}_{t}}{\\text{pop}_{t - 1}} - \\overline{g^{\\text{pop}}} \\right)^{\\eta_{\\text{pop}}}Y}_{t}^{\\text{simple}}$,\n\nwhere:\n\n  - $Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}}$ is the baseline (without policy)\n    forecast of variable $Y$,\n\n  - $Y_{t}^{\\text{simple}}$ is the “naïve” linear forecast based only\n    on past observed values of $Y$,\n\n  - $\\text{GDP}_{t}$ and $\\text{GDP}_{t - 1}$ are the contemporary\n    and previous GDP (GDP growth forecast for coming years from IMF\n    World Economic Outlook),\n\n  - $\\overline{g^{\\text{GDP}}}$ is the expected GDP growth (geometric\n    average growth over past years),\n\n  - $\\eta_{\\text{GDP}}$ is the elasticity of the outcome wrt GDP,\n\n  - $\\text{pop}_{t}$ and $\\text{pop}_{t - 1}$ are the contemporary\n    and previous population sizes (WB Population Estimates and\n    Projections),\n\n  - $\\overline{g^{\\text{pop}}}$ is the expected population growth\n    (geometric average growth over past years),\n\n  - and $\\eta_{\\text{pop}}$ is the elasticity of the outcome wrt\n    population size.\n\nWe need to subtract expected GDP/population growth from the actual\n(forecasted) GDP/population growth, as the past growth rates are\nimplicitly included in the linear forecast $Y_{t}^{f}$.\n\nAdjusting for GDP growth in this way should allow us to account for\nbooms and recessions, as for example the graphically impressive drop\ncaused by Covid-19.\n\n### Policy forecast\n\nThe impact of the carbon policy depends on the change in fuel prices and\nthe variable’s elasticity wrt fuel prices/taxes.\n\nThe fuel price is computed as follows:\n\n  - the baseline road fuel price is computed as the weighted average of\n    baseline gasoline and diesel price, where the weights equal the\n    respective fuel’s share of baseline total road fuel consumption;\n\n  - the policy road fuel price is computed as the weighted average of\n    policy gasoline and diesel price, where the weights equal the\n    respective fuel’s share of policy total road fuel consumption;\n\n  - the price change is defined as the ratio of the policy road fuel\n    price over the baseline road fuel price.\n\nWe obtain the policy forecast $Y_{t}^{\\text{policy}}$ by weighting the\nprice change by the elasticity wrt fuel price $\\eta_{p}$.\n\n$Y_{t}^{\\text{policy}} = \\left( \\frac{p^{\\text{policy}}}{p^{\\text{baseline}}} \\right)^{\\eta_{p}}Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}}$\n\nwhere $p^{\\text{baseline}}$ is the baseline road fuel price and\n$p^{\\text{policy}}$ is the policy road fuel price.\n\n### Dashboard graphics\n\nFor VKT and the three outcomes of interest, we establish similar\ngraphics in the CPAT dashboard.\n\nFor each variable, there is a line graph representing the time series of\nthe baseline forecast $Y_{t}^{\\text{baseline}}$ and the policy\nforecast $Y_{t}^{\\text{policy}}$. An example is given in Figure 7‑11.\n\nFigure 7‑11 – Urban congestion (additional time needed because of\ncongestion, for US$50 per tCO2e in 2030), Mexico\n\n![](./07/media/image9.png)\n\nSource: Tomtom, own computations.\n\nWe then plot a bar chart of the difference between the two lines of\nFigure 7‑11, representing only the change induced by the policy. An\nexample is given in Figure 7‑12.\n\nFigure 7‑12 – Averted deaths from road accidents (for US$50 per tCO2e in\n2030), India\n\n![](./07/media/image10.png)\n\nSource: WRS, OECD, UNECE, own computations.\n\nFinally, we provide some general evidence of the effect of fuel prices\non accident and congestion with a scatter graph. For this scatter graph,\nwe combine cross-sectional country-level information for a given year\nwith year-level information of all available years for the country for\nwhich the policy introduction is studied. We also add a linear\ntrendline, which captures the negative correlation between fuel prices\nand our outcomes. An example is given in Figure 7‑13.\n\nFigure 7‑13 – Historical relationship between fuel prices and road\naccident fatalities, global and Germany\n\n![](./07/media/image11.png)\n\nSource: WRS, Enerdata, EIU, IEA, own computations.\n\n### Externality cost per liter of motor fuel\n\nThis section explains how CPAT computes the externality cost (per liter\nof motor fuel) from accidents and congestion. The externality costs are\ncomputed as the co-benefits from a carbon tax-induced reduction in motor\nfuel consumption*.*\n\nThe main road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in\nroad accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle\nfleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion\n(from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in the\nvehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.).\n\nWithin CPAT, the magnitude of these co-benefits is computed using\nempirical elasticities from a large historical dataset using econometric\npanel methods. Given the multitude of channels involved in the final\nresult, the effect on accidents/congestion is not directly proportional\nto the change in vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) or the change in fuel\nconsumption. For more details on the data and estimation procedure,\nplease refer to the Technical Appendix to the CPAT Road Transport\nModule.\n\nThe externality cost is computed as follows:\n\n  - Compute baseline forecast of accidents/congestion ***without\n    policy;***\n    \n      - Baseline forecasts take into account historical growth rates,\n        adjusted for forecasted GDP and population growth.\n\n  - Compute policy forecast of accidents/congestion ***with carbon\n    tax*** of users choice;\n    \n      - Policy forecasts are the baseline forecast adjusted for the fuel\n        price change using the country-specific elasticity; this\n        country-specific elasticity is empirically estimated and\n        measures overall (i.e. across channels) which fuel prices affect\n        accidents/congestion.\n\n  - Compute for policy and baseline scenarios the ***monetary*** value\n    of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical life)\n    and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value of\n    travel time);\n\n  - Compute the ***change*** in value of accidents/congestion;\n\n  - ***Divide*** change in value by change in motor fuel consumption\n    from CPAT Mitigation Module.\n\nThe externality cost estimate <span class=\"underline\">varies each\nyear</span>. For simplicity, only one year is shown as an example in the\nCPAT Dashboard. As an example Figure 7‑14 shows the graph for Colombia.\n\nFigure 7‑14 - Externality cost per liter of motor fuel in 2024, Colombia\n\n![](./07/media/image12.png)\n\nSource: Tomtom, WRS, UNECE, OECD, IMF, own computations.\n\nNote that the TomTom Traffic Index is defined on the city-level.\nTherefore, <span class=\"underline\">the congestion externality shown in\nCPAT applies only the urban part of transport</span>. To our knowledge,\nthere is no database measuring congestion levels on the national level.\nRural transport is assumed to be free of congestion, i.e. causing zero\ncongestion externality cost.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThe CPAT Road Transport Module choses a reduced-form econometric\napproach to predict the impact of carbon taxes on road transport\nexternalities. Certain caveats must be kept in mind:\n\n  - The quality of the estimates relies on the quality of available\n    data. For certain countries/years, there is no sufficient data to\n    estimate country-specific transport externality elasticities. In\n    these cases, an internationally estimated default value was used. In\n    the Road Transport Module (Transport tab, section B – elasticities),\n    the user can see whether country-specific or default elasticities\n    have been used.\n\n  - Reduced-form approaches do not explicitly model the mechanisms. A\n    carbon tax impacts transport demand through various channels: more\n    fuel-efficient use of existing vehicles (e.g. speed, carpooling),\n    switch to less carbon-intensive means of transport (e.g. public\n    transport, non-motorized), reduction in the number/length of trips.\n    The CPAT Road Transport Module cannot disentangle these channels,\n    and can thus not attribute changes in outcomes to individual\n    channels. In particular, carbon taxes make the use of private\n    vehicles more expensive and CPAT cannot measure the loss from the\n    value of non-realized trips.\n\n  - General equilibrium effects are not included, such as changes in\n    prices or availability of the outside options. One example\n    frequently discussed are electric vehicles (EVs). Currently, CPAT\n    Road Transport Module does not include EVs. However, an extension of\n    the CPAT Road Transport Module is planned in order to include EVs.\n\n  - Elasticities, such as estimated with the CPAT Road Transport\n    Module’s methodology, predict the reaction of outcomes to *small*\n    changes in carbon taxes. CPAT Road Transport module does not account\n    for potentially non-linear responses to large policy changes. In\n    particular, large policy changes across the world may induce\n    technology changes and relevant changes in the vehicle fleet.\n\n  - A uniform carbon tax would impact not only private vehicles but also\n    lower-emitting transport modes such as buses. An increase in the\n    price of public transit could have a negative impact on people’s\n    ability to reach jobs and essential services thereby contributing to\n    fragmented labor markets and loss of welfare. Since low-income\n    households are more likely to reduce their number of trips (instead\n    of switching means of transport), a carbon tax could reduce their\n    access to economic opportunities and thereby impact inequality.\n    While it is not within the scope of CPAT1.0, understanding the\n    potential impact of carbon pricing on access to employment is\n    important to inform the development of more targeted policies that\n    can offset any such negative distributional effects of a carbon tax\n    on transit accessibility.\n\n## Status of upgrades since the last review, changes not implemented and remaining issues\n\nWe constantly update the dataset used to estimate the parameters behind\nthe CPAT Road Transport Module. So far, CPAT reflects the last complete\nupdate using the WRS 2020 edition. A further update using the WRS 2021\nedition is in progress.\n\nAs we are using proprietary data, we had to transform all non-shareable\n(proprietary) data into a shareable form. For the Road Transport Module,\nthis was mainly achieved by using (near-future) forecast based on\nhistoric data forecasts, instead of the historic data itself.\n\nWe have further added estimates of the externality cost per liter of\nmotor fuel, described in Section 7.7.5.\n\nWe are still working on two features not yet implemented:\n\n  - *Integration of electric vehicles (EVs)*: The introduction of EVs\n    and their necessary charging infrastructure is relatively slow,\n    especially in developing countries. So far, we have struggled to get\n    sufficient data for credible estimations. Nevertheless, we are aware\n    that EVs may fundamentally change the link between traffic\n    (including accidents and congestion) and carbon taxes. We are thus\n    working on a methodology to include EVs and EV-supporting policies\n    into CPAT.\n\n  - *Between-module consistency*: Currently, the VKT estimates in the\n    CPAT Road Transport Module are not linked to the transport\n    CO<sub>2</sub> in the Mitigation Module. In fact, VKT and\n    CO<sub>2</sub> may follow distinct paths as technology and driving\n    habits (e.g. number of people in a vehicle) change. Nevertheless,\n    future versions of CPAT will improve the coordination between\n    modules.\n\n## References\n\nAbrantes, P. and Wardman, M.
