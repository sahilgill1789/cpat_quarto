It is based on a\nsimplified reduced-form model of fuel consumption, with two alternative\npower sector models, one of which is a simplified structural\ntechnoeconomic power model.\n\nThe mitigation module's goal is to predict energy use, energy prices,\nemissions, carbon tax revenues, economic costs, and GDP effects for a\nbaseline and a policy scenario (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy\nefficiency policies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.), over the\ntime horizon of CPAT (2019-2035).\n\nTo this end, the module is built around different inputs, including (1)\nenergy balances and price inputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline\ninternational energy prices and macro indicators); (3) parameter inputs\n(elasticities, fiscal multipliers, etc.); (4) user-specified policy\ninputs (for example, the level and coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions\nand exemption phase-outs, and other inputs).\n\nThese inputs inform the calculation steps in which: (1) sectoral energy\nprices, including the effect of pricing policy, are determined; (2) fuel\nuse in the buildings, transport, and industry are estimated; and (3)\nelectricity production costs are calculated to feed the two power\nmodels, which then determine generation, investment, etc.\n\nThe module's outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector,\ngreenhouse gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG such as methane),\nfiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power generation, and\npower sector investment.

The mitigation module's\ngoal is to predict energy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax\nrevenues, economic costs, domestic environmental co-benefits, and GDP\neffects over the time horizon of CPAT (2018-2035) for a wide range of\nmitigation instruments (carbon pricing, fuel taxes, energy efficiency\npolicies, renewables subsidies, feebates, etc.). The main drivers of the\nemissions projections are GDP growth (including GDP-per-capita and\npopulation), income elasticities, and rates of technological change.\nFuel use responses to policies are driven principally by proportional\nchanges in fuel prices caused by projected market dynamics and\ngovernment policies (including carbon prices).\n\n![](./03/media/image1.png)\n\nFigure 3‑1: Overview of the mitigation module\n\nThe mitigation module relies on several inputs and provides numerous\noutputs. The module is at the core of CPAT, as its results feed into\nother modules.\n\n![](./03/media/image2.png)\n\nFigure 3‑2: Overview of the mitigation module’s inputs and outputs\n\nThe general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the\nresponse to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form\nmodel based on income and price elasticities.[^3_5] The changes in energy\nconsumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including\nthe influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP\n(which is the primary driver of the baseline) adjusts to changes in\nfiscal policy through multiplier effects (see the Chapter on\nMultipliers). Exogenous changes to efficiency and the price of renewable\nenergy are also drivers of fuel use and composition.\n\nThe mitigation module comprises two power sector models and simple\nmodels for industry, transport, and buildings. The two power models, the\n'elasticity-based' model and the hybrid techno-economic dynamic model\n(‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock use\nidentical power demand elasticities and separately consider power\ngeneration's costs by type. For ‘off-the-shelf’ usage of CPAT, we\nrecommend an average of the two models. For more tailored work, we\nrecommend using the engineer model.\n\nThe elasticity-based model requires only minor tailoring and checking.\nAs a result, it makes no distinction between short-term and long-term\nbehavior. It also fails to distinguish between dispatchable and\nnon-dispatchable generation types. The engineer power model fills this\ngap by separating investments, retirement, and dispatch decisions. It\nincludes countries' generation capacities and makes it possible to\ninvestigate the radically different power systems compatible with high\ncarbon prices. However, the model still cannot account for\ninflexibility, off-price policies, and local price variation (e.g.,\ncoal). Due to the constraints of Excel, it can only approximate the\ntemporal match between electricity supply and demand.\n\nThe module's outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector\n(i.e., buildings, transport, and industry). They are estimated based on\na fundamental model structure described in an IMF paper.[^3_6] Energy use\nresponds to energy prices and real GDP. Additional outputs include\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG\nemissions such as leakage methane which represents small amounts of GHG\ngases), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, economic efficiency costs,\nprice changes, power generation, and power sector investment.\n\nTo ensure that the model is correctly fitted, specific calibrations are\nundertaken for the observed years, i.e., 2019, 2020, and 2021 (and\nbeyond if necessary and if data are available). In particular, due to\nthe unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19 and Ukraine\ninvasion, energy prices may have behaved in an “anomalous” way, leading\nthe model results to deviate from the observed data. This calibration\nensures a proper starting trajectory for the model.\n\nThe rest of this section is intended to help reviewers navigate the\nMitigation documentation by highlighting the tool’s key components, and\nthe main conclusions resulting from the validation analysis of CPAT.\n\n### Niche & Use cases for CPAT\n\nCPAT requires minimal training to be used effectively. Computer\nliteracy, basic familiarity with Excel, and some understanding of\neconomic and climate concepts. Flexibility is built-in for the more\nadvanced user, to allow for different assumptions than those in the\ndefault assumption set and for choosing among various data inputs.\nAdvanced users can also input their own data.\n\nAlthough CPAT is powerful even on its own, it is still advisable to use\nit alongside other tools that may have a more granular representation,\nof say, technological detail, sectors, feedback mechanisms, trade\nlinkages, behavioral responses, etc. CPAT is designed to be light on\nresource and skill needs, providing a rapid first-cut analysis when one\nseeks to test various carbon pricing designs.\n\nThe carbon tax is the most effective instrument for emissions reduction\nin CPAT. By default, its coverage spans the whole economy, but the user\ncan also set this to select sectors. The ETS covers the whole economy by\ndefault with the option also to select coverage. A key assumption is\nthat the ETS and carbon tax are equivalent in a frictionless market with\nfull auctioning. While the ETS design lets the user select prices\n(rather than quantities), frictions imply that ETS is not as effective\nat reducing emissions as a carbon tax. The user can choose the initial\ncarbon tax level, when to commence carbon pricing, the target carbon\nprice, the year that the target level is achieved, and the sectoral\ncoverage of the carbon tax.\n\n*Strengths and weaknesses of CPAT in relation to carbon pricing\nschemes:*\n\n| **Country’s needs**                                                                  | **Yes/No** | **Remarks**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Understanding which instrument (ETS or tax) to choose.                               | No         | Like most other deterministic models, CPAT assumes that the ETS yields the same price as a carbon tax and does not currently consider offset markets.                                                            |\n| Assessing the impacts of carbon price on the economy, employment, energy/fuel prices | Yes        | CPAT provides an assessment of macroeconomic performance, energy consumption and price changes, emission reductions, distributional consequences, and co-benefits (health and traffic) of carbon pricing reform. |\n| Different allowance allocation mechanisms                                            | Partial    | CPAT has an effectiveness and revenue parameter for ETSs.                                                                                                                                                        |\n| With and without consideration of offsets                                            | No         | See above                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Different carbon tax rates for different sectors                                     | Yes        | CPAT has a consistent carbon price that can be exempted by sector and/or fuel type.

Those are shown on the top right of the main\npolicy panel.\n\n![](./03/media/image3.png)\n\nFigure 3‑3: Main Settings Panel\n\nThere is the option (**<span class=\"underline\">default to on</span>**)\nto **convert the carbon price into a GHG tax** across all sectors\n(including LULUCF, Waste, etc.) See the red dash on the bottom left of\nthe panel above.\n\nThe user can default to the Variable Renewable Energy maximum scale-up\nrate (See red arrow above). The default is ‘Country Specific,’ which\ngives and adds additional solar generation of 2% of the total power\ngenerated each year plus an extra 2% for wind (except for China which\nhas 2.5% for solar and 2.5% for wind). The implications of these maximum\nscale-up rates are in the second panel below, bottom right.\n\nInvestment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the carbon\ntax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment, i.e., we\nassume state plans respond as well as the private sector.\n\n![](./03/media/image4.png)\n\nFigure 3‑4: Power Setting Panel\n\nFourth, CPAT, by default, has two ad hoc adjustments: a Covid adjustment\nfor 2021 and 2022 and a coal share adjustment. The engineer power model\ncoal share adjustment is a country-specific value for some countries\nthat adds an intangible cost to coal generation (representing\nregulations not captured in CPAT plus lack of flexibility relative to\nnatural gas). That adjustment can be turned off in the power setting\npanel (around row 131). The setting is calibrated to current coal shares\nand long-term IEA projections.\n\n### Data choices in CPAT\n\n#### Key data used\n\n|                                                                                                                |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| For more information, Appendix G, ‘Data sources,’ gives an overview of the data used in the mitigation module. |\n\nThe main data sources are IEA data, various World Bank data sources,\nIIASA data for emissions, and Energy Prices and Energy projections are\nprimarily from the IMF (from multiple processes).\n\n#### Key parameters and choices\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><p>Sections of the Mitigation documentation detailing the key parameters and their methodology, if estimated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Elasticities: <em>3.3.5</em> Income and Price Elasticities of Demand</p></li>\n<li><p>Autonomous efficiency improvement: 3.3.5.6 Rates of technological change and exogenous rebound effects <em>and</em> <em>3.4.2.3</em> Power demand<em>.

Against this background, the following adjustments have been\nmade:\n\n  - **Overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021**:\n    Due to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by Covid-19,\n    the energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the\n    model and is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall\n    numeraire in 2020 and 2021.\n\n  - Calibration in the engineer power model:\n    \n      - **Total electricity generation**: A COVID adjustment factor can\n        be used to calibrate total electricity generation. The latter,\n        estimated by the model, is compared to observed data (IEA,\n        2020). It is worth mentioning that the default in CPAT does not\n        account for this calibration, but this calibration can be turned\n        on.\n    \n      - **Share of coal**: The share of coal in electricity generation\n        is calibrated to observed data in 2019 and 2020 (IEA, 2019 and\n        2020). The calibration uses an additional implicit price for\n        coal – if necessary – to match the observed share of coal.\n\n  - **Emissions**: In 2019, both $CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$\n    energy-related emissions are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions,\n    meaning they are multiplied by a factor such that base-year\n    emissions are equal in the model and the inventory.\n\n  - **Long-term storage is based on electrolysers**: Given its\n    interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on the\n    costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus\n    assumed as long-term storage and is measured with the interface\n    (i.e., electrolysers) as the numeraire.\n\n### Testing and validation summary\n\n|                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| The full validation analysis of the mitigation module is presented in Section 3.8 of the documentation. |\n\nThe validation of the mitigation module is composed of several elements:\n\n| Analysis performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Main conclusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Elasticities estimations.

There are some discrepancies and periods where gaps appear. However, for certain periods/countries, discrepancies of volatile magnitudes appear between CPAT projections and observed emissions. While this may result from implementing policies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from discrepancies in price forecasting. |\n| Parameter Sensitivity Analysis. The analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.                                                                                                                                       | The sensitivity of the parameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions ranges from no effect to very sensitive when focusing on the relative changes (i.e., CO2 emissions reduction relative to the default parameter).                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n### Status of upgrades since the last review\n\nThere have been many upgrades to CPAT since the last review, and the\ntable below gives a partial list to give the reviewer an idea of the\nimprovements.

Sections of\nthis document could also complement this section by presenting the\nupgrades made to CPAT since the last review and outlining desired\nupgrades, known issues, and valuable analyses not completed.\n\n#### Policy modeling\n\nCPAT abstracts from the possibility of:\n\n  - **Designing complex policy packages**, including a **combination of\n    instruments** (e.g., ETS, carbon tax, and offsets) and accounting\n    for **mitigation actions** in the baseline scenario (beyond those\n    already captured in recently observed fuel use/price data and known\n    carbon pricing mechanisms). However, policy combinations can be done\n    sequentially — analyze one policy and use this outcome as the new\n    baseline for the next policy, etc. In the same vein, CPAT does not\n    account for **international linkages across countries or emissions\n    leakage**, which prevents explicit analysis of the implications of\n    border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased attention.\n\n  - **Differences in fuel price responsiveness** may vary across\n    countries with the structure of the energy system and regulations on\n    energy prices or emission rates**.** Nonetheless, this latter\n    default can be easily adjusted in individual country analysis. In\n    addition, **feedback from carbon pricing**, like the impact of\n    carbon pricing reform on commodity prices or interest rates which\n    could be feedback to affect emission reductions, cannot be easily\n    designed in an Excel-based tool.\n\n  - **Non-linear responses to significant policy changes**, such as\n    rapid adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies\n    (deployed in the power and industry sectors) or even direct air\n    capture.\n\n  - **Upward sloping fuel supply curves and changes in international\n    fuel prices** that might result from simultaneous climate or energy\n    price reform in large countries. CPAT is parameterized to behave\n    like the mid-point of the broader modeling literature. Although many\n    models account for these factors, no big difference is observed,\n    given the relatively flat supply curves for coal.\n\n  - **Applying different coverage levels across sector groups**. CPAT\n    allows the user to select the sectors and fuels to be considered for\n    policy implementation:\n    \n      - For new policies, the coverage is binary, whether they are\n        included or not.\n      - Whenever the user defines exemptions for fuels or sectors and\n        determines a phaseout period for those exemptions, the coverage\n        can be fractional during that period.\n      - For existing policies, instead, the coverage is mostly\n        fractional, and it is currently computed as an average of the\n        fuel demand covered across sector groups or fuel types.\n\n#### Prices\n\nWhen it comes to prices, CPAT does not model:\n\n  - **Upward sloping fuel supply curves** **and changes in international\n    fuel prices** that might result from simultaneous climate or energy\n    price reform in large countries—parameter values are, however,\n    chosen such that the results from the model are broadly consistent\n    with those from far more detailed energy models that, to varying\n    degrees, account for these sorts of factors (see Section 3.8.3).\n\n  - **Institutional setup driving prices**. In CPAT, energy demand\n    responds to prices in the private sector, although the institutional\n    setup could, in some markets, prevent prices from determining supply\n    and demand.\n\n#### Emissions\n\nThe following limitations and constraints exist when computing the\nemissions:\n\n  - **In the current version of CPAT, international linkages across\n    countries or emissions leakage are not factored in**. This prevents\n    explicit analysis (in the first public version) of the implications\n    of border carbon adjustments which are receiving increased\n    attention.\n\n  - **Energy related N2O emissions are calibrated on CO2 emissions\n    preventing the independence of one from the other**.\n\n  - In the case of LULUCF CO2 emissions, **a condition to model the sink\n    activity can create an irreversible state of a positive sink** (more\n    absorptions than emissions). Even if the previous year’s emissions\n    (the year before the base year) are negative, there is no\n    possibility of returning to a negative sink.\n\n#### Energy use (all energy sectors)\n\nA first important caveat, common to all of our approaches, lies in the\nfact that the **autonomous efficiency improvement and time trend of\nconsumer preferences and technology are treated in the same way**. In\nother words, it is implicitly assumed that the time trend of consumer\npreferences and technology is not varying. However, it can be subject to\nchanges over time. For instance, technology can get more or less energy\nintensive as it changes.\n\n#### Power sector\n\nThe two different power models in CPAT have different strengths and\nweaknesses. For ‘off-the-shelf’ use, we recommend using the average of\nthe two models. We recommend the techno-economic (‘engineer’) power\nmodel specified with detailed modeling choices and input parameters for\nmore tailored use.\n\nThe **elasticity-based power model** is responsive to *relative* price\nchanges but not absolute prices. It does not explicitly model the\ncapital stock, so it cannot distinguish between short-run capacity\nfactor differences and long run capital stock changes. Thus, changes in\ngeneration for fixed capacity stock generation types may be too fast. It\nmay also model unrealistic reductions in generation from renewables if\ntheir price were to increase relative to other options. Conversely,\nchanges in generation for dispatchable types may be insufficiently\nresponsive to price. The model could produce outcomes that are not\nphysically realistic.\n\nThe **techno-economic ‘engineer’ power** model has the following\ncaveats:\n\n  - **Investment behavior in state-owned power sectors responds to the\n    carbon tax as a shadow price of carbon for government investment,**\n    i.e., we assume state plans respond as well as the private sector.\n\n  - **The power maximum retirement rate for coal is set to 80%**.\n\n  - **Estimates of national capacity by generation type across time**.\n    Since no such dataset exists globally, CPAT’s current approach\n    relies on its own estimates. Fossil capacity collected from the EIA\n    is scaled using independently estimated shares.\n\n  - **In CPAT, the investment decision is not fully commercial** but\n    assumes a quasi-least cost approach to meeting aggregate energy\n    demand (and power demand).\n\n  - **Fiscal expenditures of government investment in power are not\n    accounted for**. Such a feature is not implemented, partly because\n    power investment is typically funded by customers even if financed\n    by the government – so including it would raise consistency issues.\n\n  - **There could be a better assessment of flexibility** (and ease of\n    implementing VRE) based on the capacity reserve.\n\n  - **Losses associated with round-trip efficiency** (i.e., the ratio\n    between the power put in and the energy retrieved from storage) are\n    currently **not accounted for in the current model**. Power storage\n    consumes electricity and saves it to hand it then back to the grid.\n    The higher the round-trip efficiency, the less energy is lost in the\n    storage process.\n\n#### Desirable upgrades, known issues, and useful analyses not completed: General\n\nThis section contains our assessment of upgrades that are desirable but\nwere not able to be completed. **We do not propose to do all these\nupgrades and seek the reviewer’s opinions if any of them are must-haves\nbefore releasing CPAT to the broader community.**\n\n| Issue                                                                                                                                                | Comment/Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Emissions Factors from IIASA include process emissions and are then calibrated                                                                       | The current approach to IIASA emissions factors (which, inappropriately, include process emissions) and then calibrating total emissions is unsatisfactory.

Particular values for these general indices\nare indicated with capitals, for example, o=B for baseline.\n\nThe codes corresponding to elements of the dimensions (for example, fuel\ntypes and sectors) are also defined in tables in the appendices.\n\n#### Institutions\n\nEIA Energy Information Administration\n\nIEA International Energy Agency\n\nIIASA International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis\n\nIMF International Monetary Fund\n\nIRENA International Renewable Energy Agency\n\nJRC Joint Research Centre (institution of the European Union)\n\nNREL National Renewable Energy Laboratory\n\nOECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nUS EPA US Environmental Protection Agency\n\nWBG World Bank Group\n\n#### Abbreviations\n\nCapEx Capital Expenditure\n\nCCS Carbon Capture and Storage\n\nCO2 Carbon Dioxide\n\nCPAT Climate Policy Assessment Tool\n\nEF Emissions Factor\n\nETS Emission Trading System\n\nEV Electric Vehicle\n\nftr Fuel Transformation\n\nGDP Growth Domestic Product\n\nGHG Greenhouse Gas\n\nHIC High Income Countries\n\nHP filter Hodrick-Prescott filter\n\nLCOE Levelized Cost of Electricity\n\nLIC Low Income Countries\n\nLMIC Lower Middle-Income Countries\n\nLPG Liquefied Petroleum Gas\n\nLULUCF Land-use, Land-use Change, and Forestry\n\nMAC Marginal Abatement Cost\n\nMT Multi Scenario Tool, a spreadsheet that allows multiple-country and\n-policies use of CPAT\n\nNDC National Determined Contribution\n\nOBR Output-Based Rebating\n\nOpEx Operating and Maintenance Expenditure\n\nPM Particulate Matter\n\nPPA Power Purchase Agreement\n\nPV Present Value\n\nR\\&D Research & Development\n\nSCC Social Cost of Carbon\n\nSLCP Short-Lived Climate Pollutants\n\nUMIC Upper Middle-Income Countries\n\nUNFCCC United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n\nVAT Value-Added Tax\n\nVKT Vehicle Kilometers Traveled\n\nVRE Variable Renewable Energy\n\nWACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n\n#### Fuels\n\nBIO Biomass\n\nCOA Coal\n\nHYD Hydropower\n\nNGA Natural Gas\n\nNUC Nuclear\n\nOIL Oil\n\nREN Other Renewables\n\nSOL Solar\n\nWND Wind\n\n#### Units\n\nGJ Gigajoule\n\nGWh Gigawatt Hour\n\nktoe Kilo Tonne of Oil Equivalent\n\nkW Kilowatt\n\nkWh Kilowatt Hour\n\nkWy Kilowatt Year (=365\\*24 kWh)\n\nMMBtu Million British Thermal Unit\n\nMW Megawatt\n\nMWh Megawatt Hour\n\nMWy Megawatt Year (=365\\*24 MWh)\n\n$\\text{tC}O_{2}$ Ton of CO2 Equivalent\n\nUSD United States dollar\n\n## Fuel prices, taxes, and subsidies\n\n### Overview\n\nAt the time of writing, the base year for CPAT is 2019. The base year\nplus the next two years (2020 and 2021) are considered the ‘historical\nprice years’ for CPAT. The algorithm for the historical price years and\nthe future price years is different; we use historical price information\nin the historical price years and a forecast approach for the future\nprice years.\n\nDomestic price information for historical time periods comes from a\ndataset created by the IMF side of the joint WB-IMF team. We refer to\nthis dataset as the ‘IMF dataset’. Information about this dataset is\navailable from the IMF and is not part of this documentation. The user\ncan supplement these data with specifically-sourced data (‘manual\ninputs’).\n\nTo forecast domestic prices forward, we also use projections of\n*international* fuel prices (for example, crude oil prices). These\nforecasts are created as an average of internationally recognized\nsources. The default is an average of IMF and WB projections, although\nother options are available if the user chooses. The user should however\nmake sure that these sources are updated.\n\nWhile the method used to build the data may change from the ‘historical\nprice years’ to the years where fuel prices are forecasted, the identity\nto obtain retail prices $p_{\\text{cgft}}$ (for a given country $c$,\nsectors grouping $g$ and fuel type $f$, during period $t$) remains\nthe same: **Retail prices equal the supply costs plus all relevant\ntaxes**. As for latter, the different hierarchies, coverage, exemptions,\nand types of tax, require additional disaggregations. For instance,\nvalue added taxes may be paid on top of other taxes and fees, so it will\nbe convenient to express the retail price identity as:\n\n$p_{\\text{cgft}} = sp_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{va}t_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgft}}$\n\nwhere $\\text{sp}$ stands for the supply cost (also referred to as the\npre-tax price), $\\text{vat}$ is the value added tax, and\n$\\text{txo}$ stands for the excise and all other taxes. Furthermore,\n$\\text{txo}$ acts as net additional taxes, as it corresponds to the\naddition of consumer subsidies $\\text{cs}$, fixed or ad valorem taxes\n$\\text{fao}$, any existing carbon price $\\text{xcp}$, and any new\ncarbon price $\\text{ncp}$:\n\n$\\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgft}} = cs_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{ocgft}}$\n\nNote that the existing and new carbon prices may result from policies\nrelated either to carbon taxation or ETS permit prices, as it will be\nexplained in upcoming sections.\n\nThe table below summarizes the process used to build the information for\nprices and subsidies for the base years and the forecasted period.\nAdditional information on each element can be found in the upcoming\nsections.\n\n| Variable Code  | Variable Name                     | Base years source                                                                           | How Price is Projected                                                                                     |\n| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| $\\text{sp}$  | Supply Price                      | IMF dataset                                                                                 | Scaled according to international prices                                                                   |\n| $\\text{vat}$ | VAT                               | IMF dataset                                                                                 | Scaled according to supply price                                                                           |\n| $\\text{xcp}$ | Existing Carbon Price             | From State and Trends of Carbon Pricing (resulting from carbon taxes or ETS permits prices) | $Options$ Either a defined schedule of projections or base year carbon price plus defined growth rate    |\n| $\\text{ncp}$ | New Carbon Price                  | From dashboard                                                                              | Calculated according to policy settings                                                                    |\n| $\\text{fao}$ | Fixed, Ad valorem and Other Taxes | Computed as a residual $\\text{fao} = \\text{txo} - \\text{cs} - \\text{xcp} - \\text{ncp}$    | $Options$ Kept fixed in time or scaled according to $\\text{sp}$                                        |\n| $\\text{txo}$ | Excise and other taxes            | IMF dataset                                                                                 | Addition of forecasted components                                                                          |\n| $p$          | Retail Price                      | IMF dataset                                                                                 | *Addition of forecasted components:* $p = \\text{sp} + \\text{vat} + \\text{fao} + \\text{xcp} + \\text{ncp}$ |\n\n### Notation\n\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name\nof the variables to which they correspond.

$g$ (for prices meaning Residential,\nIndustrial-including-Services, Transport and Power). Within the sector\ngroup, prices are equal – although more granular sectoral exemptions\nmean that prices in the sector can differ.\n\n### Base years: Sources of information\n\nThe IMF dataset on prices and subsidies includes data for supply costs,\nproducer subsidies, VAT, excise and other taxes, consumer subsidies, and\nretail prices by country, sector group and fuel type. This dataset is,\nhence, at the core of the information for historical prices used in\nCPAT. Existing policies (carbon taxation or ETS permits) with\ninformation both in terms of carbon price levels as well as the fuel and\nsector coverage, complete the dataset for CPAT’s ‘historical price\nyears’. A brief description of the price components used in CPAT is\nprovided below:\n\n**Historical retail price:** Included in the IMF data set. Rounding\nerrors aside, it equals the sum of supply costs, VAT, and excise and\nother taxes.\n\n**Supply cost:** Included in the IMF data set. It is calculated as a\nweighted average of domestic extraction costs and international prices\nplus transport costs, where the weights refer to the proportion of the\ncomponents that are domestically produced or imported.\n\n**VAT:** Included in the IMF data set. Computed as VAT collected over\ntotal sales (for a given fuel and sector), or as the result of applying\na country or sector-specific VAT rate to the sales of a fuel to a\nsector.\n\n**Consumer Subsidy:** Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total\nsubsidy over total sales (for a given fuel and sector).\n\n**Producer Subsidy:** Included in the IMF data set. Computed as total\nsubsidy over total sales (for a given fuel).\n\n**Existing Carbon Price:** Sourced from *State and Trends of Carbon\nPricing*.\n\n**New Carbon Price:** User-defined. It is typically zero in the base\nyears.\n\n**Fixed ad valorem and other taxes:** Balancing item, computed as a\nresidual:\n$\\text{fao} = \\text{txo} - \\text{cs} - \\text{xcp} - \\text{ncp}$.\n\n### Forecasted years: Construction of data on prices and taxes\n\n**Supply cost** for a fuel type $f$ in a given country $c$ and\nsector grouping $g$ and during period $t$, is calculated using a\ncoefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019) to the global\nprices in the same period, multiplied by the respective international\nfuel price in year $t$:\n\n$sp_{\\text{cgft}} = \\frac{sp_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{gp_{f,t_{0}}}*gp_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nwhere $sp_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}$ denotes the average supply costs for\ncountry $c$, fuel $f$ in sector $g$ in base years $t_{0}$,\n$gp_{f,t_{0}}$ is the average global fuel price in base years, and\n$gp_{\\text{cft}}$ is the global fuel price based on the chosen\ninternational energy price forecast in year $t$. As for the latter,\nnote that information on global prices may be taken from different\nmarkets depending on the region or country.\n\nIn practice, the supply costs dependence on global prices may not be the\nsame for a country that produces the fuel vs. one that imports it.\nMoreover, the supply cost can be affected by any existing producer-side\nsubsidies, as well as by simulated policies where these would be phased\nout. The treatment of these advanced cases is presented in Appendix C -\nPrices And Taxes Methodology.\n\n**VAT payment** equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the\nsupply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:\n\n$\\text{va}t_{\\text{cgft}} = \\frac{\\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\\text{cgft}}$\n\nNOTE: 1. Users are given the option to include $\\text{txo}$ as part of\nthe VAT base; 2. The residential and transport sectors may instead be\ncomputed by applying a nation-wide constant VAT rate to the VAT base\n($\\text{sp}$, here).\n\n**Consumer-side fossil fuel subsidy:** Based on the fixed part of\nconsumer subsidy per unit of energy, the new value is adapted to account\nfor phasing-out of consumer side subsidies, and the phasing out of price\ncontrols, that create implicit subsidies.\n\n$cs_{\\text{cgft}} = cs_{cgf0}*\\phi_{\\text{CS},t} + \\left( \\text{pc}c_{\\text{cf}} - 1 \\right)*\\left( \\text{Δg}p_{\\text{ft}}*\\phi_{\\text{PC},t} \\right)$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{\\text{CS}}$ is the phase-out factor for consumer-side\nsubsidies, $\\phi_{\\text{PC}}$ is the phase-out factor for price\ncontrols, $\\text{pc}c_{\\text{cf}}$ is the price control coefficient\nand $\\text{Δg}p_{\\text{ft}}$ is the difference between current and\nprevious global prices.\n\n**Fixed ad valorem and other taxes** are projected based on last year’s\ninformation. There are two possible cases:\n\n$\\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgft}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\frac{\\text{Σfa}o_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}} & \\text{if\\ fixed} \\\\\n & \\\\\n\\frac{\\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\\text{cgf},t} & \\text{if\\ ad\\ valorem} \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $\n\nwhere $\\frac{\\text{Σfa}o_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}}$ represents\nthe average value of $\\text{fao}$ during the base year.\n\n**Existing Carbon Price:** Resulting for already implemented carbon\ntaxes or ETS permits and their prices, it is assumed that these policies\nare complemented by any new measure selected by the user. Thus, the\nprice is assumed to be equal to the latest available observation:\n\n$\\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgft}} = \\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgf},t - 1} = \\text{xc}t_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{CT}} \\right) + \\text{xets}p_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{ETS}} \\right)$\n\nwith $\\text{xc}t_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}$ and\n$\\text{xets}p_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}$ representing the existing carbon\ntaxes and ETS permit prices per energy unit, respectively. As part of\nthe advanced options, CPAT allows the user to select a fix growth rate\nfor each – the existing carbon tax and the existing ETS permit price.\nThis is captured by the parameter $\\delta$ in both cases.\n\n**New Carbon Price:** It accounts for the price resulting from the\nimplementation of new policies (carbon taxation or ETS permit prices).\nIt can be decomposed as follows:\n\n$\\text{nc}p_{\\text{cgft}} = \\text{nc}t_{\\text{cgft}} + \\text{nets}p_{\\text{cgft}} = \\text{NC}T_{\\text{ct}}*ef_{\\text{cgf}}*\\varphi_{\\text{NCT},\\text{cgft}} + \\text{NETS}P_{\\text{ct}}*ef_{\\text{cgf}}*\\varphi_{\\text{NETS},\\text{cgft}}$\n\nwhere $\\text{nc}t_{\\text{cgft}}$ and $\\text{nets}p_{\\text{cgft}}$\nstand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per\nenergy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is\nobtained based on the national price per ton of $CO2$\n($\\text{NC}T_{\\text{ct}}$ or $\\text{NETS}P_{\\text{ct}}$), and\nscaling it by the country-sector-fuel specific emission factors,\n$ef_{\\text{cgf}}$, and the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies\nwithin the country in question ($\\varphi_{\\text{NCT},\\text{cgft}}$ and\n$\\varphi_{\\text{NETS},\\text{cgft}}$).\n\nAmong the options available, the user can select the sector or fuel that\nwill be exempted from the policy implemented. This is already considered\nin the sector-fuel coverage $\\varphi$. Moreover, such exemptions can\nbe phased out according to user-defined parameters.\n\nNote that both the existing and the new ETS permit prices per ton of\nCO2, $\\text{XETS}P_{c,t}$ and $\\text{NETS}P_{c,t}$ respectively,\ncorrespond to the **adjusted** values after the penalization. In other\nwords, to the value comparable to the level of a carbon tax. For more\ninformation on this, refer to Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology.\n\n**Excise and other taxes** are computed as the sum of its forecasted\ncomponents.\n\n$\\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgf},t} = cs_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n\n**Retail price** for fuel $f$ in sector $s$ in years $t$ is the\nsum of the supply price, VAT, and excise and other taxes.\n\n$p_{o,\\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\left( cs_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{cgf},t} \\right)$\n\nIt should be noted that, while this relationship is true for all cases,\nfor the baseline scenario the new carbon price component, included in\n$\\text{txo}$, is null.\n\n### Price aggregation\n\nFor reporting purposes, it is convenient to have an aggregate price for\neach type of fuel within a country. This price, computed for each\nscenario, is obtained as a weighted average of the sector-specific\nretail prices, where the weights are given by the total use of fuel\n$f$ in country $c$:\n\n$P_{\\text{cf},t} = \\sum_{g}^{}{\\frac{F_{\\text{cgf},t}}{\\Sigma_{g}F_{\\text{cgf},t}}*p_{\\text{cgf},t}}$\n\nwhere $P_{\\text{cf},t}$ is the aggregate price for fuel $f$ in\ncountry $c$, $F_{\\text{cgf},t}$ is the use of fuel $f$ in sector\n$g$ within country $c$, and $\\Sigma_{g}F_{\\text{cgf},t}$ is the\naggregation of the fuel $f$ use across all sectors in that country.\n\n## Fuel Consumption\n\n### Overview\n\nCPAT’s mitigation module is based on a fundamental model structure\ndescribed in a recent IMF paper.[^3_15] Energy use responds to energy\nprices and real GDP (total real GDP, not per capita GDP). The price\nelasticity includes a ‘usage’ response (e.g., how much each car is used)\nand an ‘energy efficiency’ (e.g., how fuel efficient the car is)\ncomponent. The fuel equation estimate fuel consumption in the different\nsector groupings of CPAT.\n\nIn what follows, we present the equation form and then specific cases in\nwhich the equation might be slightly transformed or in which we factor\nin additional technologies in accordance with the sector under\nconsideration, that is Transport, Buildings, Industry, Other Energy Use\nand Electricity.\n\n### Notation\n\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name\nof the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are\nreported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made\nto ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n| **Notation**                | **Variable**                                                           | **Unit** |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| $F$                       | Use of fuel                                                            | ktoe     |\n| $Y$                       | Total real GDP                                                         | US$      |\n| $p$                       | Retail price                                                           | US$/Gj   |\n| $\\alpha$                  | Autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement                        | %        |\n| $\\Psi$                    | Covid adjustment factor to energy demand                               | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{Y}$            | Forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand                     | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{U}$            | Elasticity of usage of energy products and services                    | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{F}$            | Efficiency price elasticity                                            | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}$ | Substitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass | US$/Gj   |\n| $\\text{Ef}f_{f}$          | Natural gas, LPG and kerosene efficiency                               | %        |\n| $\\text{Ef}f_{\\text{bio}}$ | Biomass efficiency                                                     | %        |\n\n### Fuel Consumption Dynamics\n\nThe fuel use for fuel type $f$ and sector $s$ can be related to the\nfuel use in the previous year as follows:\n\n$\\frac{F_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{F_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha_{\\text{sf}}} \\right)^{1 + \\epsilon_{U,c\\text{sf}}}\\Psi_{\\text{ct}}\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{Y,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{csf}}\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}} \\right)}$\n\nwhere the main components of the equation are $F$, the fuel usage in\nktoe, $Y$, the total real GDP, the prices $p$ as presented in\nSection 3.2, $\\alpha$, the autonomous annual energy efficiency\nimprovement and, $\\Psi$, a Covid adjustment factor to energy demand\n(see Section 3.3.4.4). Note that additional policies affecting the\nparameter $\\alpha$ can be manually added.\n\n![Figure 36: Dashboard: Additional policy-induced efficiency gains by\nsector](./03/media/image6.png)\n\nFigure 3‑5: Dashboard: Additional policy-induced efficiency gains by\nsector\n\n$\\epsilon_{Y}$ denotes the forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel\ndemand for fuel $f$ in sector $g$. It thus translates a 1% increase\nin total real GDP into a fuel demand increase. CPAT does not distinguish\nbetween the elasticity for real-GDP-per-capita and the elasticity for\npopulation.\n\n$\\epsilon_{U}$, is the elasticity of usage of energy products and\nservices (i.e. for a 1% increase in prices, how much will total usage be\naffected in the same year).\n\nFinally, $\\epsilon_{F}$ denotes the efficiency price elasticity.\n\nFor more information on the elasticities and the autonomous annual\nenergy efficiency improvement, see Section 3.3.5. The latter is set to\n0.5% or 1%, depending on the sector.\n\nThe terms of the energy use equation represent:\n\n  - A **GDP effect**\n    $\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{Y,\\text{csf}}}$\n  - A **price effect on usage**\n    $\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}}}$\n  - A **price effect on energy efficiency**,\n    $\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{csf}}\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}} \\right)}$\n\nBoth autonomous and price-driven efficiency components are subject to\nrebound effects by raising to the power of\n$\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U} \\right)$, where $\\epsilon_{U}$ is negative.\n\nNote that the term effect on energy efficiency is affected by the shadow\nprice[^3_16] in case non-pricing policy types are implemented, that is\nfeebates and power feebates, energy efficiency regulations, vehicle fuel\neconomy, residential and industrial efficiency regulations. In the\nequation, the shadow price only affects the efficiency margin and not\nthe price effect since, for instance, an energy efficiency regulation\ndoes not aim to increase prices but increases the efficiency.\n\nFor simplicity, we assume that all the effects take place over the\ncourse of one year. In reality, some effects will take time, but CPAT\nabstracts from these effects. CPAT is more suited to anticipated and\nprogressively phased policies over the medium term.\n\nEnergy use is aggregated into five main sector groupings: Transport,\nBuildings, Industry, Other Energy Use and Electricity demand.\n\n### Specific cases\n\nFew specific cases slightly affect the energy use equation described\nabove or the energy composition, that is:\n\n  - The breakdown of biofuels and existence of jet fuel in the transport\n    sectors;\n  - Self-generated renewables in the building and industry sectors;\n  - The substitution between biomass and LPG/kerosene/natural gas in the\n    residential sector;\n  - For the year 2020-21, energy use is calibrated with a Covid\n    adjustment;\n  - Fuel transformation; and\n  - Other energy use sector.\n\n#### Biofuels and jet fuel\n\nIn the transport sector, for road transport only, biomass is further\nbroken down into Bioethanol, Biodiesel and Other Biofuels. In addition,\ndomestic aviation jet fuel is a fuel type not seen in other sectors.\n\n#### Self-generated renewables\n\nWhen aggregating energy use at the sector level, power generated outside\nof the power sector, that is self-generated renewables, is also\naccounted for. The energy use equation is the same as the one presented\nabove, and the price used is that of solar energy.\n\n#### Biomass substitution in the residential sector\n\nWhen aggregating energy used, an option to account for **leakage into\nbiomass** in the residential sector is available.\n\n![Figure 37: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT](./03/media/image7.png)\n\nFigure 3‑6: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT\n\nIf this option is turned on, a percent change of the most used cooking\nfuel (i.e., natural gas, LPG or kerosene) is transferred to biomass. In\nother words, the relative price change in the most used cooking fuel\nresults in a percentage change in its consumption; this variation change\nis substituted by biomass. The latter is composed of the substitution\nelasticity between the most cooking fuel used and biomass\n($\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}$), but also accounts for the relative\nefficiency between the fuels considered, that is only natural gas, LPG\nand kerosene ($f = \\text{nga},\\text{lpg\\ and\\ ker}$) and biomass\n($\\text{Ef}f_{f}$ and $\\text{Ef}f_{\\text{bio}}$, respectively):\n\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}*\\frac{\\text{Ef}f_{\\text{bio}}}{\\text{Ef}f_{f}}$\n\nThe substitution elasticity between the most cooking fuel used and\nbiomass, $\\epsilon_{\\text{bio},f}$, is 0.25 (see Section 3.3.5 for\nmore information). The efficiency[^3_17] for each fuel is detailed in the\ntable below:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Energy type</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Natural gas</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.58</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>LPG</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.56</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Kerosene</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.45</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Biomass</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.20</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe proportion of the natural gas transferred to biomass is thus\ndependent on the relative efficiency of representative stoves that are\nused. Therefore, for a 10% price change in, for instance, natural gas,\n0.9% of natural gas consumption is shifted to biomass.\n\n#### Calibration of overall energy use through Covid adjustment in 2020 and 2021\n\nDue to the unprecedented global economic shock induced by the Covid-19,\nthe energy consumption factor makes an ad hoc adjustment to the model\nand is calibrated using emissions outturn as the overall numeraire in\n2020 and 2021.\n\nThis sets baseline 2020 emissions to equal estimates for most countries\nand applies a GDP-linked scalar adjustment for all other countries to\nmatch global emissions (difference in recent three-year average GDP\ngrowth vs. 2020 growth rate times 1.4). For 2021, emissions are set for\nvery large emitters (US, China, India, EU) to a specific rebound\nvs. 2019 emissions per the Global Carbon Project (2021), and to a\nscalar that results in -4.2% vs. 2019 emissions for all other countries.\nEstimates can be found at the end of the tab ‘GHG’.\n\n![Figure 71: Summary of the CPAT v1.0 structure](./03/media/image8.png)\n\nFigure 3‑7: Summary of the CPAT v1.0 structure\n\n#### Fuel transformation\n\nIn CPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings,\nindustry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation\nin balances) and fuel transformation. The fuel transformation sector\n(FTR) is determined as **the difference between primary and final energy\nconsumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector**. This\nresidual is treated as an additional industrial sector called fuel\ntransformation.\n\nIn addition, all oil products and natural gas are aggregated to avoid\ndealing with negative fuel consumption. The FTR, computed as a residual,\nis treated as an additional industrial sector called ‘transformation’.\nFor the forecasted years, its consumption follows the main mitigation\nfuel equations.\n\n#### Other energy use\n\nThe other energy use sector contains principally military fuel use. No\ncarbon taxes are imposed in this sector.\n\n### Income and Price Elasticities of Demand\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe current version of CPAT uses a derived set of elasticities based on\nBurke and Csereklyei (2016)[^3_18] using the relationship from Gertler\nand others (2016).[^3_19]\n\n#### Income elasticities\n\nIncome elasticities relate to general energy demand (electricity,\ntransport, industry, services, residential and other).\n\nIncome elasticities of energy demand are selected based on a broad\nliterature review, simplified, adjusted for development levels, and\nsense-checked to a large dataset of income elasticities and outputs of\nother models. There are 32 ‘base’ income elasticates in CPAT covering\neight energy sources (coal; natural gas; gasoline; diesel; other oil\nproducts like LPG and kerosene; biomass; small-scale renewables like\nsolar PV; and electricity) and four sectors (transport including road,\nrail, aviation and shipping; residential; heavy industries; and public\nand private services).\n\nThese are then sense-checked against a database of income elasticities\ncollected by the authors, which covers over 250 studies 2,000\nobservations of income elasticities across countries. Next, these are\neach adjusted for income per capita of the country considered in each\nprojection period (‘adjusted income elasticities’) to reflect the broad\nfinding that income elasticities decline with development. Lastly, the\nelasticities are checked once more through model intercomparison:\ncomparing the baseline projections from those of many other global,\nregional, and country-specific models. The process is described further\nbelow.\n\n![Figure 54: Income elasticities: Base income elasticities of energy\ndemand in CPAT](./03/media/image9.png)\n\nFigure 3‑8: Income elasticities: Base income elasticities of energy\ndemand in CPAT\n\nBase income elasticities for sectors are selected based on Burke and\nCsereklyei (2016), which covers 132 countries from 1960-2010.\nFuel-specific elasticities within sectors are then selected based on a\nliterature review such that the weighted global average income\nelasticity across fuels is within one standard deviation of those found\nfor sectors (left panel of Figure 3-55). Broadly, energy demand grows\nmore quickly in services, industry, transport, and other sector than it\ndoes in the residential or agricultural sectors.\n\n![Figure 55: The relationship of fuel demand to GDP across countries –\nby sector (left panel, mean estimated elasticities 1960-2010) and by\ndevelopment levels (right panel, unadjusted and adjusted elasticities\nwith respect to log GDP 1985-2010)](./03/media/image10.png)\n\nFigure 3‑9: The relationship of fuel demand to GDP across countries by\nsector (left panel, mean estimated elasticities 1960-2010) and by\ndevelopment levels (right panel, unadjusted and adjusted elasticities\nwith respect to log GDP 1985-2010) – Source: left panel from Burke and\nCsereklyei (2016); right panel inferred from Gertler and others (2016),\nadjusted upwards to match the global average income elasticity for\nenergy in left panel\n\nIt is then further assumed that income elasticities have a reverse-U\nshape with respect to income levels. This relationship has been found by\nnumerous studies (Gertler et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2018; Liddle and\nHuntington 2020; Caron and Fally 2022). This non-homothetic relationship\nbetween incomes and energy could be reflective of the rapid rise in\nownership of key energy consuming assets like refrigerators, air\nconditioners, and vehicles whose ownership tends to binary in nature\n(e.g. households purchase one fridge but not additional fridges as they\nbecome wealthier; Gertler et al. 2016). It could also reflect the\nEnvironmental Kuznets effect (as incomes increase economies reduce their\nenvironmental destruction by, for example, consuming fewer fossil fuels)\n(Saqib and Benhmad 2021) or ‘dematerialization’ (richer countries tend\nto need fewer materials for marginal production and hence become more\nenergy efficient).\n\nThe relationship between per capita incomes and energy demand is derived\nfrom Gertler and others (2016) based on data cross-country analysis\n1985-2010. This is then adjusted upwards such that the inferred global\naverage income elasticity from this shape equals that found by Burke and\nCsereklyei (0.74, 2016) over the same time period (1960-2010). This\nadjustment is then applied to each base income elasticity’s base for\neach country over the projection period (varying with each year). The\nimpact for selected fuel-sector pairs is shown in left panel below for\nper capita GDP and in the right panel for log GDP. Income elasticities\njump up as countries graduate from being lower-income to a peak around\nlower-middle income status (at around $3,000 per capita) and then\nasymptotically decline until reaching the developed country maximum (at\naround $22,000 per capita).\n\n![Figure 56: Per capita GDP adjusted income elasticities, selected\nfuels/sectors by GDP (left) and log GDP (right)](./03/media/image11.png)\n\nFigure 3‑10: Per capita GDP adjusted income elasticities, selected\nfuels/sectors by GDP (left) and log GDP (right) – Source: IMF staff\nusing Burke and Csereklyei (2016), Gertler and others (2016), and\nvarious other sources.\n\nLastly, the results of these income elasticities on baseline energy\nconsumption and emissions are then sense checked through a model\ninter-comparison. Overall, they allow for initially rapid accelerations\nin energy demand in developing countries (as households purchase\nenergy-consuming goods like fridges, air conditioning units and cars) as\nwell as broader structural change as countries increase the share of\nservices in GDP and energy consumption.\n\n#### Price elasticities\n\nOwn-price elasticities of energy demand are parametrized using a similar\napproach to income elasticities. A major meta-study to estimate\nelasticities for fuels, which are then simplified and calibrated to\nallow for sectoral coverage, sense- and then finally sense checked to a\nlarge in-house dataset through model-intercomparison. These steps are\ndescribed in turn.\n\nPrice elasticities in CPAT separated into two broad margins (see below).\nCPAT contains two types of price elasticities to distinguish between\nbehavioral responses: the direct reduction in demand from reduced\nintensity of use from existing capital-consuming goods like vehicles\n(‘intensive margin’) and changes in the composition and scale of those\ngoods (‘efficiency and extensive margin’). The two effects combined less\nthe rebound effect (described later) correspond to the total price\nelasticity of demand, which is parametrized to the empirical\nliterature[^3_20].\n\nTable 3‑1 Price elasticities of energy demand in CPAT – Source: IMF\nstaff using various sources. Tables show price elasticities used for\ndeveloped countries. For developing countries, extensive margin\nelasticities are uniformly increased (in absolute terms) by 0.1.\n\n![Figure 57: Price elasticities of energy demand in\nCPAT](./03/media/image12.png)\n\nThe initial source for price elasticities is a meta-study by Labandeira\nand others (2017). This includes about 2,000 empirically estimated\nelasticities from 430 studies with broad global coverage of countries,\nseven fuels, and four sectors (refer to Table A for descriptive\nstatistics). ‘Target’ estimates of elasticities for fuels and sectors\nare estimated, assuming that the base is the transport sector, plus\ndeviations for the residential, industrial and services sectors (Table\nB)[^3_21]. For any statistically insignificant values for fuels within\nsectoral regressions (natural gas in residential, for example), it is\nassumed that the difference between sectoral and base elasticities equal\nthat sectors’ general elasticities multiplied by a scalar for all energy\nsources.\n\nAdditionally, there is evidence that price elasticities are slightly\nhigher for developing countries (about 10%; Labandeira, Labeaga, and\nLópez-Otero 2017). Price elasticities are therefore adjusted slightly\nupwards for developing countries (on the extensive margin) such that\nthey are a similar magnitude higher than for developed countries.\n\nSimple price elasticities (rounded to 1 decimal point) on both the\nintensive and extensive margin are then calibrated to those targets. As\nshown in Table C, when weighting for developed and developing countries’\nemissions, elasticities in CPAT are very similar (within 10%) to these\ntarget elasticities.\n\nTable 3‑2: Comparison of price elasticities\n\n![Figure 58: Comparison of price elasticities](./03/media/image13.png)\n\nThese, price elasticities are sense checked both against a large\ndatabase of price elasticities (covering around 250 studies and 2,500\nprice elasticities), as well as through model intercomparison of CPAT\nresults compared with those of other models. Both the baseline emissions\nprojections and price responsiveness of emissions is broadly in line\nwith that of other models, while median price elasticities are not\nsignificantly different for fuel-sector pairs collected across countries\n(though there is variation).\n\nLastly, all elasticities are long-term elasticities.\n\n#### Rebound effect\n\nWhen prices change, energy consumers also shift to more efficient\nenergy-consuming goods. Marginal costs of fuel consumption are lower for\nmore efficient goods (e.g. each km travelled is cheaper for a vehicle\nwith higher fuel economy), hence there is a corresponding increase in\ndemand for those same fuels (‘direct rebound effect’). As marginal costs\nof fuel consumption decline, consumers also increase the intensity of\nconsumption of these capital goods (e.g. travel more miles in vehicles).\n\n![](./03/media/image13.png)*Table* *3‑3: Implied direct rebound effects\nfrom prices (endogenous efficiency improvements increasing demand for\nenergy)*\n\nThe energy use equation outlined in Section 3.3 allows rebound effects,\n$\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U} \\right),$ to be captured and compared to\neconometric estimates of rebound. Broadly, these align with the\nempirical literature. More specifically, the rebound effect is defined\nas the product of the energy efficiency elasticity and the usage\nelasticity, $\\epsilon_{F}*\\epsilon_{U}$, as follows in the term\naffecting prices change:\n\n$\\left( \\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F} + \\epsilon_{U} + \\epsilon_{F}*\\epsilon_{U}}$\n\nWith $\\epsilon_{F} = \\epsilon_{U} = - 0.3$, the rebound effect\nrepresents 15.5% (i.e. the rebound effect reduces the total price\nelasticity by 15.5%). This result is lower, but seems more reasonable,\nthan the estimates in a meta-analysis of 74 studies in Dimitropoulos and\nothers (26-29% rebound effect, 2018).\n\nThe estimated leakage effects in residential natural gas (31%) are\nsimilar to those found in studies (20% to 30%, Haas and Biermayr 2000).\n\n#### Cross-price elasticities\n\nCPAT contains three substitution or cross-price elasticities to account\nfor the risk that households that face increases in costs for\nresidential heating and cooking fuels shift to informal fuels like\nbiomass. This ‘leakage’ effect can have a negative impact on household\nair pollution and hence welfare, which is calculated by CPAT’s air\npollution module. These cross-price elasticities (biomass with respect\nto LPG and kerosene, as well gasoline with respect to diesel) are\nparameterized to the same broad literature review.\n\nTable 3‑4: Cross-price elasticities of substitution in CPAT\n\n![Figure 60: Cross-price elasticities of substitution in\nCPAT](./03/media/image14.png)\n\n#### Rates of technological change and exogenous rebound effects\n\nThe annual rate of exogenous technological change (that is, not induced\nby policies under consideration in CPAT) are set at between 0.5 and 1\npercent per year for each fuel-sector pair.\n\nTable 3‑5: Exogenous efficiency improvements in energy-consuming capital\ngoods (cars, buildings, factories)\n\n![Figure 61: Exogenous efficiency improvements in energy-consuming\ncapital goods (cars, buildings, factories)](./03/media/image15.png)\n\nIt should be noted that – as with efficiency induced endogenously by\nprice changes – exogenous efficiency improvements reduce marginal costs\nof energy consumption, hence there is some rebound effect that partly\noffsets the reduction in demand from improved efficiency. A large\nliterature exists that examines the rebound effect from efficiency\nimprovements, with estimates varying significantly, from 0 to 300%\n(Saunders et al. 2021). In CPAT, this rebound from exogenous efficiency\nimprovements depends on the fuel-sector pair and its corresponding\nintensive margin and efficiency, but broadly it is between 20% to 60%\nacross fuels and sectors.\n\nTable 3‑6: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (% of\nemissions reduction reduced)\n\n![Figure 62: Rebound effect from exogenous efficiency improvements (% of\nemissions reduction reduced)](./03/media/image16.png)\n\n#### References\n\n1.

The user can choose to use the elasticity,\nengineer model, or a simple average of the two models. We recommend the\n‘average’ model for ‘off-the-shelf’ use of CPAT and the engineer model\nfor more tailored usages and for non-marginal changes (like a high CO2\ntax policy). Before presenting the two models, it is essential to note\nthat by default, prices and generation costs are applied to both the\ntechno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models. The\nmain differences are as follows:\n\n  - **The 'elasticity-based' model** uses marginal increases in fuel\n    prices and price elasticities to determine the shares of each\n    generation type. It is simple, transparently parameterized, easily\n    explainable, and easily deployable in an Excel spreadsheet model\n    used in previous versions of CPAT and IMF tools.\n\n  - **The ‘engineer model'** explicitly models the capacity of different\n    generation types, with capacity[^3_22] expanding to meet desired\n    power demand. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is allocated\n    according to marginal price, with a sigmoidal function of relative\n    price. Investment is also a function of levelized cost, with a\n    system penalty for the cost of integrating high levels of renewable\n    penetration. Transmission losses are modeled as a fixed quantity of\n    total generation. The model allows modeling decisions changing the\n    stock of assets in the power sector (investment and retirement) and\n    decisions changing the use of assets for power generation\n    (dispatch). In addition, the model allows the user to define a\n    constraint on Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate. The\n    rates reflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation\n    in VRE additions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in\n    gross additions, not net of retirements). The model is consistent\n    with countries' generation capacities and makes it possible to\n    investigate the radically different power systems consistent with\n    high carbon prices, while the empirical 'elasticity-based' model is\n    valid only for more marginal changes.\n\nIn what follows, Section 3.4.1 defines power prices and generation\ncosts, Section 3.4.2 describes the techno-economic model, and Section\n3.4.3 the elasticity-based model. Finally, Section 3.4.4 presents the\nparameter choices of the power models.\n\n### Power prices and generation costs\n\nThis section describes the determination of generation costs and power\nprices in CPAT. These prices and generation costs are applied to the\ntechno-economic (‘engineer)’ and the elasticity-based power models.\nHowever, in the latter case, the user has an alternative option to use a\nsimpler set of prices based on the original IMF board paper, which are\nnot covered here.\n\n#### Overview\n\nPower generation costs have the following components:\n\n  - Variable (per kWh) operations and maintenance costs;\n  - Fixed (per MW) operations and maintenance costs;\n  - Decommissioning and waste disposal costs;\n  - Fuel cost before the introduction of the carbon pricing policy;\n  - Existing or new renewables subsidies;\n  - Existing or new carbon price or other policy (feebate, excise duty\n    on electricity); and\n  - Systems cost of integration, modeled as short+long-term storage\n    costs as a function of variable renewable energy (VRE; meaning\n    wind+solar+other renewables, but not including hydro or biomass)\n    share.\n\nIn addition, we impose an implicit price of coal relative to gas,\nreflecting unobserved environmental regulations on coal and the superior\nflexibility of gas. These aspects are not fully captured in a model as\nsimple as this. We calibrate this price on observed coal shares and\nfuture (IEA) projections (see Section 3.4.2.4).\n\nEnd-user (industrial and residential) power prices additionally have the\nfollowing components:\n\n  - Estimated transmission and distribution costs (different for\n    industry and residential);\n  - Net historical subsidy or tax (estimated either via a price gap or\n    via independent data if provided by the user);\n  - Any correction for under- or over-estimated transmission and\n    distribution costs (exists only if we have concrete subsidy data);\n  - New carbon tax as imposed on the generation types and passed on to\n    the end user; and\n  - Any electricity excise or rebate of the carbon price\n    (Feebates/Output-based-rebating).\n\n#### Notation\n\nThe tables below present the notations used in the section and the name\nof the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are\nreported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made\nto ensure that they match our calculations.\n\nThe first table gives overarching concepts relating to power generation.\n\n| **Notation**          | **Variable**                                                                         | **Unit** |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |\n| $F$                 | Use of fuel                                                                          | ktoe     |\n| $g$                 | Electricity generation                                                               | GWh      |\n| $\\nu$               | Thermal efficiency                                                                   | %        |\n| $\\text{cf}$         | Capacity factor                                                                      | %        |\n| $\\text{cap}$        | Capacity                                                                             | MWy      |\n| $\\text{PV}$         | Present value of costs                                                               |          |\n| $\\text{tic}$        | Levelized total investment costs                                                     | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{wacc}$       | Weighted Average Cost of Capital                                                     | %        |\n| $\\text{lif}$        | Lifetime                                                                             | Years    |\n| $\\text{dlf}$        | Discounted lifetime                                                                  | Years    |\n| $\\Phi_{\\text{inv}}$ | New investment expressed as a proportion of total existing capacity less retirements | %        |\n| $\\text{gns}$        | Generation shares                                                                    | %        |\n\nThis table denotes variables used to calculate the levelized cost of\ninvestment types (and also, indirectly the power price).\n\n| **Notation**      | **Variable**                                        | **Unit** |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| $\\text{fc}$     | Projected unit fuel costs                           | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{opv}$    | Variable costs for operating and maintenance (OpEx) | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{vc}$     | Current variable costs                              | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{cax}$    | Capital cost (CapEx)                                | US$/kW   |\n| $\\text{opf}$    | Fixed costs for operating and maintenance (OpEx)    | US$/kW   |\n| $\\text{tfc}$    | Fixed OpEx                                          | US$/kWy  |\n| $\\text{sto}$    | Storage cost                                        | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{dtc}$    | Decommissioning costs                               | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{ipc}$    | Implicit price component for coal                   | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{pusRen}$ | Per-unit renewable subsidies                        | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{LCOE}$   | Levelized cost of electricity                       | US$/kWh  |\n\nThis table denotes variables used to calculate the price of electricity.\n\n| **Notation**               | **Variable**                                          | **Unit** |\n| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| $\\text{hrp}$             | Historical retail prices in the electricity sector    | US$/Gj   |\n| $\\text{gnc}$             | Current generation cost                               | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{fix}$             | Amortized fixed costs                                 | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{ca}x^{\\text{av}}$ | Weighted average CapEx                                | US$/kW   |\n| $\\text{acc}$             | Yearly amortization of capital costs                  | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{int}$             | Interest costs                                        | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{dec}$             | Yearly amortization of decommissioning costs          | US$/kWh  |\n| $sp_{T}$                 | Supply power price determined in the engineer model   | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{tmc}$             | Transmission cost                                     | US$/kWh  |\n| $mu^{T}$                 | Markup used in the calculation of supply power prices | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{pex}$             | Power excise                                          | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\text{reb}$             | Rebate                                                | US$/kWh  |\n| $p^{T}$                  | End-user power price (engineer model)                 | US$/kWh  |\n\n#### Power generation cost and price concepts\n\nWe use four different power generation cost/price concepts in CPAT:\n\n  - **Current Variable Costs**: For dispatch decisions the current\n    variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and\n    maintenance).\n  - **Levelized Cost of Investment**: For forward looking (investment)\n    decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all\n    cost components is used. For example, one part is *forward-looking\n    expectations* of future fuel and carbon costs.\n  - **Cost-recovery generation cost**: For estimating the total running\n    cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is\n    estimated. This includes current variable cost, running amortization\n    of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and other components\n    too). The cost-recovery generation cost by generation type is\n    averaged and then transmission and distribution costs added to\n    produce an overall estimate cost of generating and distributing\n    electricity.\n  - **End user power prices** (residential and industrial): these are\n    based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost\n    changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of\n    changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also\n    choose to phase out estimated electricity subsidy.\n\n#### Concept 1: Current variable costs\n\nVariable costs are used in the dispatch decision directly between gas\nand coal.[^3_23]\n\nCurrent variable costs are defined as the sum of the following cost\ncomponents:\n\n$vc_{\\text{ocft}} = \\text{vo}p_{\\text{ocft}} + fc_{\\text{ocft}} + ip_{\\text{cft}} = \\text{vo}p_{\\text{ocft}} + \\frac{p_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\nu_{\\text{cf}}} + ip_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nwhere:\n\n  - $\\text{vop}$ represents variable costs for operating and\n    maintenance, that is variable OpEx in USD per kWh.\n  - $\\text{fc}$ denotes projected unit fuel costs before the\n    introduction of the carbon pricing policy. These costs are\n    calculated as the ratio of pre-tax prices (including producer-side\n    subsidies) $\\text{ps}$ and thermal efficiency $\\nu$:\n    $\\frac{ps_{\\text{cft}}}{\\nu_{\\text{cf}}}$. It is worth noting that\n    no improvements in time is currently modeled. By default, fuel costs\n    are considered as a moving average over a 5-year window. The option\n    to use spot prices can be enabled in the dashboard:\n\n![](./03/media/image17.png)\n\nFigure 3‑11: Dashboard: Use Spot Fuel Prices in Engineer Power Model\n\n  - $\\text{ip}c_{\\text{cft}}$ denotes an implicit price component for\n    coal. Note that this latter component could be turned off in the\n    settings and not taken into account (for more information, see\n    Section 3.4.2.4).\n\n#### Concept 2: Levelized costs of generation (Forward-looking)\n\n##### General approach\n\n  - LCOEs by generation type are estimated as a forward-looking\n    (discounted cashflow) approach.\n  - Note these is different from the cost-recovery prices above as the\n    cost-recovery approach uses an amortization of capital costs and\n    running interest costs rather than discounting.\n  - Fuel and carbon costs in these LCOEs are forward-looking, meaning\n    they are the discounted value of future cashflows assuming full\n    confidence in the proposed policy and full foresight.\n\nForward-looking generation costs are defined using a levelized cost of\nelectricity (LCOE) methodology, which relies on discounting at the\nappropriate discount rate. Levelized cost enables the comparison of\ndifferent energy technologies with different characteristics (operating\nlifetime, capacity factor, construction cost, and time) on an equivalent\nbasis. To the levelized cost, we add system integration costs. The\nlevelized cost can be defined, in general, as the discounted sum of\ncosts divided by the discounted sum of electricity produced. Let’s\nassume that a generation technology produces power for $N$ years, and\nwe start counting at year zero (so there are $N$ payments, with the\nfirst being $t_{0}$ and last being $t = N - 1$. We separate the\ncomponents $q$ (capital cost) of the levelized costs, which can be\ntreated equivalently. For each component $q$ of the levelized cost:\n\n$\\text{LCO}E_{q} = \\frac{PV_{q}}{\\text{dem}} = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}$\n\nwhere $PV_{q}$ is the present value of costs, $\\text{dem}$ is the\ndiscounted power produced, $g_{t}$ is the power produced at time $t$\nand $C_{q,t}$ is the $q$ component of costs at time $t$, breaking\ndown into the following components:\n\nThe full investment cost contains the following components:\n\n  - Capital expenditure\n  - Decommissioning (all generation types) and waste disposal cost\n    (nuclear only)\n  - Variable OpEx\n  - Fixed OpEx\n  - Fuel Cost Before Carbon Price\n  - Marginal system cost of storage (see next section)\n  - Carbon Price\n  - Implicit cost of coal\n\nEach of these components is calculated using the levelized cost formula\nabove. Almost all components are either fixed or increasing/decreasing\nat a fixed rate. In that case we can use a geometric series\napproximation. See the appendices for a derivation.\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is by default\nincome-dependent:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Income Level</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>WACC Assumed</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>HIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.075</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>UMIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.100</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>LMIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.125</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>LIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.150</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe WACC can also be technology-dependent, i.e. it can be specified for\neach technology. At the same time, the WACC can be specified for the\nbaseline and the policy scenario. Finally, the WACC can be defined\nglobally by the user.\n\nThe levelized total investment costs is defined as:\n\n$\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cf}} = \\frac{vc_{P,\\text{cft}}*cf_{\\text{cf}}*\\text{df}c_{\\text{cft}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*\\text{df}c_{\\text{cft}}} + \\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{fl}}$\n\nwhere $\\text{df}c_{\\text{cft}}$ is the discount factor\n$1 + \\text{wac}c_{\\text{cft}}^{t - t_{0}}$ and\n$\\text{fi}x^{\\text{fl}}$ denotes the forward-looking levelized fixed\ncosts, which is calculated as:\n\n$\\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{fl}} = \\frac{\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*365*24*\\text{dl}f_{\\text{cft}}} + \\frac{\\text{dt}c_{\\text{cft}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*365*24*\\text{dl}f_{\\text{cft}}} + \\text{st}o_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{op}f_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{pusRe}n_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nwhere $\\text{cax}$ is the capital cost, $\\text{dtc}$ is th\ndecommissioning total cost, $\\text{sto}$ is the cost of storage,\n$\\text{fro}$ correspond to fixed costs for operating and maintenance,\n$\\text{dl}f_{\\text{cft}}$ denoting the discounted lifetime of each\ngeneration type $f$ and $\\text{re}s_{\\text{cft}}$ reflects the\nper-unit renewable subsidies (if added).\n\nIn the dashboard, the following option allows the user to specify\nrenewable subsidy under a baseline and policy scenarios:\n\n![](./03/media/image18.png)\n\nFigure 3‑12: Dashboard: Renewable subsidy ($/kwh in nominal terms)\n\nAfter the introduction of the carbon pricing policy, the current total\ncost is:\n\n$\\text{LCO}E_{P,\\text{cft}} = vc_{P,\\text{cft}} + \\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{fl}}$\n\nwhere\n$vc_{P,\\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\\text{cft}} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{cft}}$.\n\n##### LCOE methodology: Simplification\n\nAs mentioned in the main text:\n\n$\\text{LCO}E_{q} = \\frac{PV_{q}}{g} = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{q,t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}$\n\nwhere $PV_{q}$ is the present value of costs, $g$ is the discounted\npower produced, $g_{t}$ is the power produced at time $t$ and\n$C_{q,t}$ is the $q$ component of costs at time $t$, breaking down\ninto various components described in the above section.\n\nThere is a simplification in the case of **constant growth rates**. If\nat and after time $n$ the residual components of the cashflow have\nconsistent real (logarithmic) growth rate $\\tau$, i.e.,\n$C_{t} = C_{n}e^{g\\left( t - n \\right)}$, then they form a geometric\nseries, which can be summed analytically:\n\n$\\begin{matrix}\n\\text{PVofCosts} & = \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + \\sum_{t = n}^{N - 1}C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t - n} & & & \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$\n\n$= \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\sum_{t = n}^{N - 1}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t - n}$\n\n$= \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - n - 1}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t}$\n\n$= \\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}} + C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\frac{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{N - n}}{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)}$\n\nIf a component is fixed in time, i.e. $\\tau = 0$ and $n = 0$,\nthere’s a further simplification:\n\n$\\text{PVofCosts} = C_{n}e^{- \\text{rn}}\\frac{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{N - n}}{1 - \\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)} = C_{0}\\frac{1 - e^{- \\text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}$\n\n$\\begin{matrix}\n\\text{LCOE} & = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}} & = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{0}e^{\\text{τt}}e^{- \\text{rt}}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}} & = \\frac{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}C_{0}\\left( e^{\\tau - r} \\right)^{t}}{\\sum_{t = 0}^{N - 1}g_{t}e^{- \\text{rt}}} & = \\frac{C_{0}\\frac{1 - e^{- \\text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}}{g_{0}\\frac{1 - e^{- \\text{rN}}}{1 - e^{- r}}} & = \\frac{C_{0}}{g_{0}} \\\\\n\\end{matrix}$\n\n#### Concept 3: Cost-recovery estimated total cost of generation\n\n  - Generation costs are modeled by component (CapEx, OpEx, Fuel costs\n    etc). These are ‘cost recovery prices’ assuming amortization of\n    CapEx, interest costs and so on.\n  - Weighted average generation costs are then augmented by global\n    assumptions on transmission costs, to give estimated cost recovery\n    price.\n  - Then the cost recovery price is compared to observed prices and the\n    difference attributed to being a tax or subsidy (if no independent\n    subsidy data is available) or an under/overestimated cost if\n    independent (user entered) subsidy-data is available.\n  - For cost recovery, a weighted average CapEx of the capital stock is\n    needed. For most generation types, the CapEx per MW is constant, but\n    for renewable energies it declines rapidly so the weighted average\n    invested amount per MW is estimated by taking a weighted average of\n    the current running total with the cost of new additions.\n\nThe current generation cost before tax, $\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cft}}$,\nis thus composed of both variable and fixed costs:\n\n$\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cft}} = vc_{B,\\text{cft}} + \\text{fi}x_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nwhere $\\text{vc}$ denotes current variable costs (defined in an\nearlier section) and $\\text{fix}$ denotes amortized fixed costs.\n\nAmortized fixed cost is the sum of the following elements:\n\n$\\text{fi}x_{B,\\text{cft}} = \\text{ac}c_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{in}t_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{de}c_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{st}o_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{op}f_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nWhere:\n\n  - $\\text{acc}$ is the yearly amortization of capital costs per kWh\n    produced:\n    $\\frac{\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{av}}}{\\text{cf}*365*24*\\text{li}f_{f}}$\n    with $\\text{ca}x^{\\text{av}}$ the weighted average CapEx,\n    $\\text{cf}$ the assumed capacity factor and $\\text{lif}$ the\n    lifetime for each fuel. The weighted average CapEx is defined as:\n    $\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cf},t - 1}^{\\text{av}}*\\left( 1 - \\Phi_{\\text{inv}} \\right) + \\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}*\\Phi_{\\text{inv}}$\n    with $\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}$ the CapEx and $\\Phi_{\\text{inv}}$\n    the new investment expressed as a proportion of total existing\n    capacity less retirements. It is worth noting that the base year,\n    $t_{0}$, corresponds to $\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}$. Over time,\n    the CapEx is not varying, except for renewables (for more\n    information see Section 3.4.4.4).\n\n  - $\\text{int}$ is the interest costs per kWh produced, assuming a\n    straight-line amortization of CapEx:\n    $0.5*\\frac{\\text{ca}x_{\\text{cft}}^{\\text{av}}*\\text{wac}c_{\\text{cf}}}{cf_{\\text{cf}}*365*24}$\n    where $\\text{wacc}$ is the WACC. The WACC can be adjusted\n    according to different settings and both under a baseline and policy\n    scenarios.\n\n![](./03/media/image19.png)\n\nFigure 3‑13: Dashboard: WACC Settings\n\n  - $\\text{dec}$ denotes the yearly amortization of decommissioning\n    costs[^3_24] per kWh produced:\n    $\\frac{\\text{dt}c_{B,\\text{cft}}}{cf_{B,\\text{cf}}*365*24*\\text{li}f_{f}}$\n    where $\\text{dt}c_{\\text{cft}}$ denotes the decommissioning and\n    transmission costs in USD per kW (for more information see Section\n    3.4.4.4).\n\n  - $\\text{sto}$ defines the weighted average storage cost of\n    vintages, which corresponds to the marginal storage costs for\n    renewable energies.\n\n  - Finally, $\\text{opf}$ represents fixed costs for operating and\n    maintenance, that is fixed OpEx expressed in USD per kWh according\n    to the capacity factor of each fuel:\n    $\\frac{\\text{tf}c_{\\text{cft}}}{365*24*cf_{\\text{cf}}}$ where\n    $\\text{tfc}$ is the fixed OpEx expressed in USD per kWy.\n\n#### Concept 4: End-user prices\n\n  - End-user prices are taken to be equal to current prices plus any\n    change in underlying generation cost.\n  - *Observed* power prices are used as the basis of the demand model.\n  - *Changes* in generation costs (including those caused by carbon\n    prices and any due to the phase-out of aforementioned subsidies) are\n    assumed to be passed on to consumers (the proportion of pass-on\n    defaults to 100% but can be altered.). If the parameter setting\n    price controls is set to not one (could be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) then\n    all price changes (from technology changes or carbon price) are\n    diminished in the same proportion.\n\nTo estimate power prices (i.e. before the policy tax is introduced), the\nweighted current generation cost is calculated as follows:\n\n$\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} = \\sum_{f}^{}gns_{B,\\text{cft}}*\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cft}}$\n\nFor each country, the weighted average of generation cost\n$\\text{gn}c_{B,c}^{\\text{av}}$ is calculated according to generation\nshares $\\text{gn}s_{B,\\text{cft}}$ of each fuel $f$ and their\nrespective current generation cost $\\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{cf}}$.\n\nIn the engineer model, power prices are processed specifically in the\nresidential and non-residential sector (i.e. industrial sector). The\nsupply price in the technoeconomic model $sp_{B,\\text{cg}}^{T}$ (where\nthe index $T$ holds for technoeconomic model) is determined in the\nresidential and industrial sectors\n($g = \\text{Residential},\\text{Industrial}$) via a fixed positive\nincrement corresponding to transmission cost ($\\text{tmc}$) to the\nweighted average generation cost such as:\n\n$sp_{B,\\text{cg}}^{T} = \\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} + \\text{tmc}$\n\nAn allowance of $15/MWh and $40/MWh was added to account for\ntransmission and distribution costs for industrial and residential uses,\nrespectively[^3_25].\n\nA markup $\\text{mu}$ is then calculated specifically for residential\nand industrial electricity prices to equalize the starting year price\n(i.e. historical retail prices in the electricity sector,\n$\\text{hr}p_{\\text{cg}}$), as follows:\n\n$mu_{B,\\text{cgt}}^{T} = \\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} + \\text{tmc} - \\text{hr}p_{\\text{cg}}.$\n\nIt is worth noting that when the markup is negative (i.e. retail prices\nare lower than modeled supply prices), the model captures a subsidy.\n\nCarbon taxes are applied at the fuel-input stage to each generation.\nHowever, for the purposes of the overall generation cost, those costs\nare excluded as part of the generation cost average and averaged, and\nadded on, separately. This is for the reason that doing this way allows\nus to calculate easily a needed rebate when rebating is employed.\n\nThe final residential and industrial end user power price in the\ntechnoeconomic power model, $p_{P,\\text{cg}}^{T}$, is calculated as\nfollows when a carbon price, $\\text{nc}p_{\\text{cg}}$, power excise,\n$\\text{pe}x_{P,\\text{cgt}}$, a rebate, $\\text{re}b_{\\text{cg}}$, are\nintroduced:\n\n$p_{P,\\text{cgt}}^{T} = \\text{gn}c_{B,\\text{ct}}^{\\text{av}} + \\text{nc}p_{\\text{cgt}} - \\text{re}b_{P,\\text{cgt}} + \\text{pe}x_{P,\\text{cgt}} + \\text{tmc} + mu_{B,\\text{cgt}}^{T}$\n\nAt this stage two end-user power price settings are included:\n\n  - Output Based Rebating: the total carbon price is added to the\n    generation types and then subtracted from overall power prices so\n    that the overall policy is revenue-neutral.\n  - Electricity Excise: a per-kwh tax is *added* at the end-user stage\n\n### Techno-economic (‘engineer’) power model\n\n#### Overview\n\nElectricity is widely acknowledged to be critical to ‘deep\ndecarbonization’ scenarios, in the sense that alternatives such as\nrenewables primarily generate electricity instead of solid, liquid, or\ngaseous energy vectors. Deep decarbonization involves decarbonizing the\nexisting power sector and electrifying sectors that currently use fossil\nfuels directly. Electrification will also involve expanding the power\nsector to accommodate the increased power demand from this shift in\nenergy vector. Such a structural model is important for the following\nreasons:\n\n  - **Marginal versus radical**. Elasticity-based models are arguably\n    best suited to price-based demand-side effects of marginal increases\n    in fuel prices. They are less well suited to the non-marginal\n    changes required for deep-decarbonization Paris-compliant scenarios.\n  - **Within bounds of equipment**. Power systems involve two\n    significant sets of decisions: decisions that change the stock of\n    power generation assets (investment and retirement) and decisions\n    that change the use of those assets for electricity generation\n    (dispatch). Without determining the capital stock, it is unclear\n    that a particular choice of generation is consistent with the actual\n    generation capacities of a specific country. An elasticity-based\n    approach can produce non-physically realistic results (i.e., power\n    dispatched that requires implicit investment rates faster than what\n    is realistic).\n  - **Responsiveness to absolute levels of renewable costs**.\n    Elasticity-based models can be unresponsive to actual levels of\n    costs since it is based principally on the changes in cost.\n  - **Using accurate, referenced generation cost data**. The\n    elasticity-based model used data that was at times not clearly\n    referenced and not recently updated. For example, the percentage of\n    non-fuel costs in total coal generation costs seems inconsistent\n    between the spreadsheet and the published IMF paper. Neither are\n    directly referenced against currently published costs.\n  - **Renewables costs are rapidly changing**, and it is helpful to\n    model this explicitly.\n  - **The model should include, and the outcomes depend on, carbon\n    price-dependent switching carbon prices for generation and\n    investment**. It’s helpful to know the ‘switching cost’ (for\n    example, between coal and gas) in terms of the dispatch decision and\n    the investment decision as a valuable marker of required carbon\n    taxes to begin decarbonization.\n  - **Modeling the new reality**. According to Bloomberg New Energy\n    Finance data, newly built renewables have already achieved\n    cost-parity with newly built fossil fuel plants in many parts of the\n    world. Consequently, the near future is likely to look very\n    different from the past, even without any policy-led acceleration of\n    the deployment of renewables. Indeed, the recent deployment of\n    renewables has tended to surprise on the upside (e.g., actual\n    deployment has tended to outpace IEA projections). It’s unclear\n    whether an elasticity-based model can fully capture these rapidly\n    changing dynamics.\n\n**Summary of algorithm**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the model has four types of prices:\n\n  - **Current Variable Costs**: For dispatch decisions, the current\n    variable costs are used (fuel and variable operations and\n    maintenance).\n  - **Levelized Cost of Investment**: For forward-looking (investment)\n    decisions, a levelized and forward-looking cost approach adding all\n    cost components is used. For example, one part is *forward-looking\n    expectations* of future fuel and carbon costs.\n  - **Cost-recovery generation cost**: For estimating the total running\n    cost of the power system, a cost-recovery generation cost is\n    calculated. This includes current variable cost, running\n    amortization of capital costs, plus average interest costs (and\n    other components too). The cost-recovery generation cost by\n    generation type is averaged and then transmission and distribution\n    costs are added to produce an overall estimated cost of generating\n    and distributing electricity.\n  - **End user power prices** (residential and industrial): these are\n    based on observed prices with an adjustment for changes due to cost\n    changes or carbon pricing. The user can decide what proportion of\n    changes to overall generation cost are passed on. The user can also\n    choose to phase out the estimated electricity subsidy.\n\nThe outlines of the algorithm are as follows:\n\n1.  End-user prices and GDP changes drive power demand by CPAT sector.\n    (Some components of these prices are lagged one year to avoid\n    circularity as Excel uses sequential rather than optimizing logic.)\n\n2.  According to historical energy balance data, transmission losses,\n    own use, and net exports are added as fixed proportions of\n    aggregated power demand.\n\n3.  Current inflexible capacity (renewable, nuclear) are assumed to\n    dispatch at historical capacity factors, and the remainder is\n    allocated to coal and gas according to available capacity using a\n    logit formula based on variable cost.\n\n4.  Old capacity is retired according to either to defined data on\n    retirement schedules (coal) or an exponential process (other\n    generation types), with cost-based early retirement also included\n    and an option to schedule retirement of coal.\n\n5.  Aggregate new generation capacity is added to meet expected demand\n    assuming historical capacity factors.\n\n6.  Renewables are assumed to require both short- and long-duration\n    storage, with assumed piecewise-quadratic total storage\n    requirements, implying piecewise-linear marginal storage\n    requirements. These storage requirements are approximately modelled\n    based on global technical models. These storage costs are added to\n    generation costs for Variable Renewable generation types.\n\n7.  Needed additions to aggregate ‘effective’ capacity (i.e. additions\n    to expected generation) are then allocated according to another\n    logit formalism based on total levelized costs by generation type,\n    with the cheapest generation types taking the main share of the\n    investment.\n\n8.  Renewables also have a maximum scale-up rate, set by default to 2\n    percentage points of total generation for wind and solar\n    additional-generation. This setting can be changed by the user.\n    Needed capacity beyond the limits are reallocated to other\n    generation types according to the logit proportions. If there is\n    still an unmet need for generation (for example in a high-hydro\n    situation where new hydro investment is prohibited), the model will\n    *in extremis* override VRE scaleup limits and the allowed investment\n    types and invest in proportion to the current proportions of\n    capacity in the system.\n\n9.  Capacities after retirement and new investment are passed forward as\n    the starting point of the model for the next year.\n\n#### Notation\n\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name\nof the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are\nreported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made\nto ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n| **Notation**                                | **Variable**                                                                                                                                                       | **Unit**                            |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |\n| $F$                                       | Use of fuel                                                                                                                                                        | ktoe                                |\n| $Y$                                       | Total real GDP                                                                                                                                                     | US$                                 |\n| $p$                                       | Retail price                                                                                                                                                       | US$/Gj                              |\n| $\\alpha$                                  | Autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement                                                                                                                    | %                                   |\n| $\\Psi$                                    | Covid adjustment factor to energy demand                                                                                                                           | %                                   |\n| $\\epsilon_{Y}$                            | Forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand                                                                                                                 | %                                   |\n| $\\epsilon_{U}$                            | Elasticity of usage of energy products and services                                                                                                                | %                                   |\n| $\\epsilon_{F}$                            | Efficiency price elasticity                                                                                                                                        | %                                   |\n| $g$                                       | Electricity generation                                                                                                                                             | GWh                                 |\n| $E$                                       | Total quantity of power demanded by sector                                                                                                                         | GWh                                 |\n| $\\text{net}$                              | Net exports (imports)                                                                                                                                              | ktoe                                |\n| $\\text{eiu}$                              | Energy industry’s own use                                                                                                                                          | ktoe                                |\n| $\\Delta^{\\text{dif}}$                     | Transmission and statistical differences                                                                                                                           | ktoe                                |\n| $x$                                       | The variable x is used in the logit formula to alternatively represent investment, $x = \\text{inv}$, or generation $x = \\text{gen}$                            | GWh                                 |\n| $K$                                       | Parameter adjusting the shape of the sigmoidal function.

(%) |\n\n#### Power demand\n\nThe power demand, $E_{\\text{cgt}}$, determines the total quantity of\npower demanded by sector. At present, our power demand is determined the\nsame way as the equations outlined in Section 3.3.3, with fuel type\nequal to power (electricity) ($f = P$):\n\n$\\frac{E_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{E_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha_{\\text{sf}}} \\right)^{1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{sf}}}\\Psi_{\\text{ct}}\\left( \\frac{Y_{c,t}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{G,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{ocsf},t}}{p_{\\text{ocsf},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{csf}}\\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U,\\text{csf}} \\right)}$\n\nwhere $E$ is expressed in ktoe, $Y$ is the total real GDP,\n$\\alpha$, the autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement. The\nprices $p$ correspond to total (industrial and residential) power\nprices, as in Section 3.3.3). These prices respond to changes in\nweighted total generation cost, which is lagged by one year to avoid\ncircularity issue.\n\nA Covid adjustment factor to power demand $\\Psi$ can be taken into\naccount (see Section 3.3.4.4 - note this is specifically calibrated for\nthe engineer model). Note that additional policies affecting the\nparameter $\\alpha$ can be manually added.\n\nThat power demand from the elasticity model can also be used (it is very\nsimilar, just not disaggregated by sector):\n\n![Figure 41: Mitigation: Use Elasticity Model Power Demand In Engineer\nModel](./03/media/image20.png)\n\nFigure 3‑14: Mitigation: Use Elasticity Model Power Demand In Engineer\nModel\n\nThe total generation requirement (in ktoe), $g_{\\text{oc},t}$, is\ntherefore calculated as the sum of the total demand of all sectors\naugmented (subtracted) by the proportion – based on the base year – of\nnet exports (imports), $\\text{ne}t_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}$, the energy\nindustry’s own use, $\\text{ei}u_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}$, and transmission\nand statistical differences, $\\Delta_{t_{0}}^{\\text{dif}}$:\n\n$g_{\\text{oc},t} = \\sum_{s}^{}E_{\\text{ocs},t}*\\left( 1 + \\text{ne}t_{\\text{oc},t_{0}} + \\text{ei}u_{c,t_{0}} + \\Delta_{c,t_{0}}^{\\text{dif}} \\right)$\n\n#### Power supply\n\n##### Logit function\n\nTwo different cost-based decisions are considered in the engineer model:\nthe dispatch decision, determining how existing power plants are used,\nand new investment planning. In both of these decisions, the\n‘multilogit’ function is used, with the probability of investment\nand dispatch of a technology increasing as a function of the price\ndifferential with alternatives. A parameter $K$ adjusts the shape of\nthe sigmoidal function that can be refined upon review of leading power\nsector models employing a similar approach. They determine the speed of\ntransitioning between generation types with a different cost. The $K$\nparameters are set with defaults set subjectively at 2 for both dispatch\nand investment, which we believe produces realistic results. This\nparameter can be adjusted in the dashboard:\n\n![](./03/media/image21.png)\n\nFigure 3‑15: Dashboard: K parameters\n\nThe formula of the multilogit is as follows:\n\n$\\frac{x_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}x_{\\text{ocft}}} = \\frac{e^{- K.c}}{\\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K.c}}$\n\nwhere $\\frac{x_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}x_{\\text{ocft}}}$ is the\nproportion (i.e. investment, $x = \\text{inv}$, or generation\n$x = \\text{gen}$) allocated to generation type $f$, and $c_{i}$ is\nthe relative cost of generation type $f$ (i.e. the total levelized\ncost of electricity in the case of investment or variable costs $i$.\n\n##### Dispatch decision\n\nDispatch decisions are based on a multi-step process.\n\nThe model first determines generation from nuclear, renewables, biomass\nand oil according to their capacity factor and the total supply\nrequired. In particular, renewables are assumed to produce power\naccording to their installed capacity multiplied by historical capacity\nfactors.\n\nIn the case of renewables, they are assumed to be non-dispatchable\nmeaning their capacity factor is fixed. Nuclear, biomass, and oil\ngeneration are assumed to be semi-dispatchable meaning that if power\ndemand falls relative to the base year, they too will reduce their\ncapacity factor proportionally. But they will not increase their\ncapacity factor. For nuclear, the low variable cost makes it economical\nalways to run the plant when available. For biomass and oil, we simplify\nas we do not wish to model merit order decisions with many different\nfact (hourly peaking needs, environmental regulations etc).\n\nThen, residual energy demand is determined by an explicit choice between\ncoal and gas based on the variable cost of each (including the carbon\ntax). In other words, the remaining generation needed after nuclear,\nrenewables, biomass and oil generation are subtracted, is allocated to\ncoal and gas.\n\n$\\text{reqge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA} + \\text{GAS},t} = g_{\\text{oc},t} - \\sum_{\\text{fϵ}\\left( \\text{RE},\\text{NUC} \\right)}^{}cap_{f}*cf_{f}$\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum coal needed assuming gas runs at maximum\ncapacity and vice versa for coal. The maximum capacity is by default set\nto 90%, but the user can adjust it in the dashboard:\n\n![Figure 44: Dashboard: Use energy balances or (CPAT) energy consumption\ndata](./03/media/image22.png)\n\nFigure 3‑16: Energy balances and energy consumption\n\nFor example, for coal:\n\n$\\text{minge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t} = \\text{reqge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COAL} + \\text{GAS},t} - \\text{ca}p_{\\text{GAS}}*\\text{maxC}f_{\\text{GAS}}$\n\nThen, the remaining required generation after these minima are allocated\nto coal and natural gas, $g_{f}$, is determined based on their\nrelative marginal costs, using the logit formulation:\n\n$\\lambda_{f} = \\frac{e^{- K_{\\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{\\text{dispatch}}.H_{f}}}$\n\nwhere $f$ is restricted to coal or natural gas and $\\lambda_{f}$ is\nthe proportion of the residual generation (after the ‘minimum coal’ and\nminimum gas’ allocation given limited capacity of the other) allocated\nto each of coal and gas. The term $H_{g}$ is the ratio\n$\\frac{vc_{P,\\text{cft}}}{vc_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}}$, where the\n(marginal) variable cost is given by $vc_{P,\\text{cft}}$ and\n$vc_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}$ is the variable cost of the lowest\ncost option between coal and natural gas,\ni.e. $f \\in \\left\\{ \\text{coal},\\text{naturalgas} \\right\\}$, and\n$K_{g}$ is the K parameter specific to generation.\n\nPower generation for coal thus becomes:\n\n$g_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t} = \\text{minge}n_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t} + \\lambda_{f}*\\text{residualreqge}n_{\\text{oc},\\frac{\\text{COA}}{\\text{GAS}},t}$\n\nwhere $\\text{residualreqgen}$ denotes the residual power generation\nfrom coal and gas.\n\nThis procedure gives overall raw generation shares (assuming no PPAs),\n${\\widetilde{\\gamma}}_{\\text{ocf},t}$. It is worth noting that to the\nextent PPAs exist, a fixed capacity factor is used. Therefore, the\nlatter is downscaled if the ‘needed’ coal and gas generation is less\nthan what is implied by their default capacity factors. The total\ngeneration mix becomes:\n\n$\\gamma_{\\text{ocf},t} = \\left( 1 - \\omega_{\\text{oct}} \\right)*{\\widetilde{\\gamma}}_{\\text{ocf},t} + \\omega_{\\text{oct}}*\\Omega*\\left( \\text{ca}p_{\\text{ocft}}*CF_{\\text{cft}} \\right)$\n\nwhere $\\gamma_{\\text{ocf},t}$ is the generation share after PPAs\n$\\omega$ denotes the percentage PPAs and $\\Omega$ a downscaling\nfactor if needed generation is different from that which is determined\nby the raw capacity factors.\n\n##### Retirement and capacity needed\n\nAt the start of the analysis, the capital stock is based on electricity\ngeneration capacity data by fuel type from Enerdata. Required effective\ncapacity is equal to expected generation capacity and is defined as\ncapacity multiplied by the expected capacity factor -– i.e., the\ninvestment is set such that the capacity is sufficient to cover expected\npeak demand, which is estimated using the power demand equation (see\nSection 3.4.2.2).\n\nThe economic system is expected to plan ahead a few years in advance so\nthat investment takes place to meet the projected demand at the start of\neach year at the same time as retirement is modeled to happen. Capacity\nfor the first year is thus determined based on IEA data.\n\nFor the following years, new capacity is thus equal to the old capacity,\nless retirements, and plus any new investments needed. The total\nrequired generation capacity is given by the expected power demand minus\nthe generation capacity (last year’s capacity less retirements):\n\n$g_{\\text{ocft}} = g_{\\text{ocf},t - 1} - \\sum_{f}^{}ret_{ocf,t - 1} + inv_{ofc,t - 1}$\n\nIt is assumed that a generation dependent proportion, $\\text{ret}$, of\nall generation assets retire each year, equal to the reciprocal of the\naverage lifetime $\\text{lif}$ of that generation type.\n\n$\\text{re}t_{\\text{ocft}} = \\frac{1}{\\text{lif}}*\\text{ca}p_{\\text{ocft}}$\n\nFor coal, it is worth noting that planned retirement is adjusted based\non the coal power plant tracker, which provides power plant data level\nfor a number of countries. Therefore, based on these data, the\nretirement year of each power plant is determined and the capacity\nassociated is determined from 2022 to 2050[^3_26]. When data do not\nexist, the above formula is used.\n\nIn addition to planned retirement, cost-based early retirement coal is\nalso estimated as additional policies could accelerate retirement for\ncoal power plants. In this respect, the model:\n\n  - First finds the maximum of coal that could be replaced by wind and\n    solar. The maximum coal retirement is estimated as a fixed\n    proportion (default 80%) of coal total effective capacity.\n  - Second, it compares the variable cost of coal with the total cost of\n    wind and solar.\n  - Third, it calculates through a logit formula a proportion of the\n    maximum coal replacement (depending on relative costs):\n\n$\\text{re}p_{\\text{oc},\\text{coa},t} = 1 - \\frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,\\text{COA}}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{r,f}}}$\n\nwhere $H_{r,\\text{coa}}$ is the ratio\n$\\frac{vc_{\\text{oc},\\text{coa},t}}{vc_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{lc}}}$ and\n$H_{r,f}$ is the ratio\n$\\frac{vc_{\\text{ocft}}}{vc_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{lc}}}$ with\n$f \\in \\left\\{ \\text{coal},\\text{solar},\\text{wind} \\right\\}$. The\nterm $\\text{re}p_{\\text{oc},\\text{COA},t}$ denotes the proportion of\ncoal replacement.\n\nFinally, the estimated proportion $\\text{re}p_{c,\\text{coa},t}$ is\nmultiplied by the maximum of coal retirement.\n\nTherefore, the total retirement is equal to the sum of planned\nretirement and cost-based early retirement.\n\n##### Investment decision and non-VRE and VRE scale up limitations\n\nInvestment decisions are constrained by non-VRE and VRE limits and are\nbased on two rounds:\n\n  - New investments permitted: A logit function capped by a VRE limit\n    that spreads out investments across technologies based on the\n    cheapest levelized costs.\n\n  - Allocated remaining capacity needed: A least-cost merit order\n    algorithm allocates remaining capacity needed according to\n    generation costs across technologies.\n    \n      - Logit function constrained by scale-up limits\n\nSimilarly as dispatch and retirement, new investment is spread out\nacross the cheapest levelized possibilities, according to a multilogit\nformulation (with K parameter = 2):\n\n$\\frac{\\text{iv}p_{\\text{ocft}}}{\\sum_{f}^{}{\\text{iv}p_{\\text{ocft}}}} = \\zeta_{\\text{cft}}*\\frac{e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}{\\sum_{i}^{}e^{- K_{i}.H_{i}}}$\n\nWhere: $\\zeta_{\\text{cft}}$ stands for new investments permitted in\npercentage. The user has the possibility to enable new investments (in\nMW). $\\text{iv}p_{\\text{cft}}$ denotes the proportion of new\ninvestments $K_{i}$ the K parameter specific to investment decisions.\nThe term $H_{i}$ is the ratio\n$\\frac{\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}}{\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}}$,\n$\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}$ and\n$\\text{ti}c_{P,\\text{cft}}^{\\text{lc}}$ define, respectively, the\nlevelized investment cost and the lowest levelized investment cost\nacross fuel types. It is important to note that renewables face a\npenalty at high levels (i.e. above 75% penetration) as an additional\n‘storage systems cost’ could increase costs (see Section 3.4.2.5 on\nLong-term storage).\n\nDifferent options are possible for whether new investments are permitted\n($iv^{\\text{new}}$):\n\n  - *If present* is the default option and allows new investments in the\n    model if nameplate capacity \\> 0. Otherwise, no investment is\n    accounted for.\n\n  - *Yes* allows the user to introduced planned investments, that is\n    specifying a start year.\n\n  - *No* disables new investments.\n\n  - *Manual* allows the user to enter data. These data will override the\n    data determined by the model and new capacity will be accounted for\n    as: New Nameplate Investments (MW) = Capacity data entered by the\n    user + Planned Retirement.\n\n![](./03/media/image23.png)\n\nFigure 3‑17: Dashboard: Plan or enable new investment\n\nMaximum effective investments, $\\text{iv}^{\\max},$ are then capped by\nnon-VRE and VRE limits ($\\text{VRE}$):\n\n${\\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\max} = g}_{\\text{oc},t}*\\zeta_{\\text{cft}}*VRE_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nDefault non-VRE limits are set to 5% for coal and natural gas and 2% for\nhydro, oil, other renewables, nuclear and biomass. Default VRE limits\nare set to 2% (i.e. for wind and solar).\n\nCPAT allows the user to define non-VRE and VRE scale up rates. The rates\nreflect a ‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE\nadditions to be a certain percentage of total generation (in gross\nadditions, not net of retirements). For VRE rates, the following rates\ncan be selected: Low (1%), Medium (2%), High (3%), Very High (4%),\nUserDefined and CountrySpecific (currently set to 2% – except for China\n2.5%). The default is country specific.\n\n![](./03/media/image24.png)![Figure 46: Dashboard: Scale up rate\nparameter](./03/media/image25.png)\n\nFigure 3‑18: Dashboard: Scale up rate parameters (right panel: non-VRE\nrate; left panel: VRE rates)\n\n![](./03/media/image26.png)\n\nFigure 3‑19: Dashboard: Scale up rate specification for wind and solar\n\n  - Least-cost merit order\n\nThe logit approach and the scale-up limitation determines ‘allocated’\ninvestment. But there is still some needed investment that is not\nallocated. We use a least cost merit order approach to determine the\ncurrently ‘unallocated’ investment need.\n\nThe least cost algorithm ranks the generation types in terms of the cost\nand then use up all their available space (within the capacity limits)\none by one, starting with the cheapest and so on.\n\nFirst of all, the algorithm defines the **remaining unallocated\ninvestment need**. New effective investment before reallocation are\ndefined as the minimum between maximum effective investments and new\ninvestments permitted in order to make sure investments cannot be\nsuperior to the maximum capacity. Therefore, this allows to determine\nthe remaining investments needed, $iv^{\\text{rem}}$:\n\n${iv_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{rem}} = \\ iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\max} - \\min{(\\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\max},\\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{new}})}$\n\nSecond, **generation costs are ranked from the cheapest to the most\nonerous across technologies** in order to allocate remaining capacity\nneeded.\n\nThird, remaining capacity are thus **allocated in a second round of\ninvestment** according to the cheapest technology in a cumulative way.\n\nFinally, **total new investments equals investments permitted over the\ntwo rounds of investments**, that is before reallocation and after\nreallocation:\n\n$iv^{\\text{tot}} = \\text{iv}_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{new}} + \\ iv_{\\text{ocft}}^{\\text{rem}}$\n\n##### Calibration and systems costs \n\nTwo calibrations are performed in the engineer power model, that is (1)\na **calibration on the total electricity generation** and (2) an\ninferred value for systems cost, **calibrated on the share of coal**.\n\nFirst, to ensure proper calibration of the engineer power model in 2020,\n**a COVID adjustment factor can be used to calibrate total electricity\ngeneration**. The latter, estimated by the model, is compared to\nobserved data (IEA, 2020). The adjustment factor is calculated as the\npercentage difference between the estimated and observed data. Results\nper country can be found in the tab ‘CovidAdjust’. For countries not\ncovered by the IEA database, the factor adjustment is similar to the\nCovid adjustment on energy consumption (see Section 3.3.4.4).\nImportantly, in 2021, a rebound effect is introduced.\n\nBy default, the adjustment factor is set to 0. However, the user can\nrely on the adjustment factor by modifying the setting to 1 (see below).\nIt should be mentioned that the lower and upper limits are set at 25%,\nwhich means that the factor adjustment cannot be less (more) than -25%\n(25%).\n\n![](./03/media/image27.png)\n\nFigure 3‑20: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment\n\nSecond, **systems costs are currently inferred by using a calibration on\nthe share of coal in the electricity generation.** This exercise is\ncarried out using observed data in 2019 based on observed data from the\nIEA and consists of matching observed data for the coal share in the\nelectricity generation. Systerms costs are equivalent to an additional\nimplicit price for coal, $\\text{im}p_{c,\\text{coa},t}$. Inferred value\nfor system costs are thus used for the years after 2019, with the\nexception of the year 2020. The latter is considered as exceptional\nbecause of the Covid shock. Therefore, the exercise is repeated for this\nyear, as systems costs could be higher. IEA’s forecasts on the share of\ncoal in total electricity generation for the year 2030 are also reported\nfor information only.\n\n![](./03/media/image28.png)\n\nFigure 3‑21: Dashboard: Covid Adjustment\n\nFor the years 2019 and 2020, the following steps are taken:\n\n  - The share of coal in total electricity generation is calculated for\n    both the power model’s estimates and observed data from the IEA.\n  - To account for the difference between these two values, the “goal\n    seek difference” is expressed as the following distance between\n    estimated and observed coal share:\n    $\\left( \\text{co}a_{t}^{\\text{est}} - \\text{co}a_{t}^{\\text{obs}} \\right)^{2}$,\n    where $\\text{coa}l_{t}^{\\text{est}}$ denotes the share of coal\n    estimated by the power model and $\\text{coa}l_{t}^{\\text{obs}}$\n    represents the observed share of coal for\n    $t \\in \\left\\{ 2019,2020 \\right\\}$.\n  - As estimated coal share is often over-estimated compared to observed\n    data, the goal seek difference is thus addressed by increasing\n    prices for coal (i.e. an implicit price component) in order to\n    reduce the difference between estimated and observed coal share.\n    Only positive implicit price components are considered.\n\nResults of additional implicit prices are reported in the tab\n‘GoalSeekCoal’ for both 2019 and 2020. By default, CPAT uses the\nadditional implicit prices. However, an option in the dashboard allows\nthe user to turn this assumption off or to manually add the implicit\nprice component.\n\n![Figure 73: Dashboard: Coal share calibration](./03/media/image29.png)\n\nFigure 3‑22: Dashboard: Coal share calibration\n\nIf the “Manual” option is selected, the user overrides the implicit\nprice component with their choice.\n\n![Figure 74: Dashboard: Coal share calibration\n(manual)](./03/media/image30.png)\n\nFigure 3‑23: Dashboard: Coal share calibration (manual)\n\n#### Storage decision\n\nCPAT has a simple model of electricity storage. The required storage\nconsists of two elements, short and long-term. Both long and short-term\nstorage is related to the proportion of renewable energy (VRE)\ngeneration as a percentage of total electricity generation. VRE includes\nwind and solar and other renewables but not hydro and biomass.\n\nBecause the model does not represent renewable energy generation\nprofiles, relative quantification of balancing capabilities, or\nvariability in demand, a “system integration cost” is imposed on higher\nshares of variable renewable energy (VRE). This cost is assumed to be an\nincreasing function of VRE share. This additional cost forms part of the\ninvestment decision. The cost of integrating renewables is particularly\nsignificant at high levels (i.e. \\>50% by generation) of renewable\npenetration into an electricity mix. Against this background, two\ndifferent types of storage are considered in the model:\n\n  - Short-term storage, which are costly per kWh but cheap per kW\n    (e.g. batteries measured in kWh).\n  - Long-term storage, which are costly per kW but cheap per kWh\n    (e.g. electrolysis and hydrogen tanks measured in kW).\n\nFor both types of storage there is an additional ‘hours’ ratio,\nmeasuring the ratio of battery capacity (kwh) to battery interface (kw),\nand electrolysers (kw) to hydrogen storage (kwh). Each storage aspect is\ntwo-dimensional, meaning that every storage technology is determined by\nan ‘interface’ (kW) and a ‘storage quantity’ (kWh). The model measures\nstorage according to one ‘numeraire’ and one ratio. For short-term\nstorage, we measure the kWh and assume a standard 4-hour ratio between\nthe kWh and kW in determining the costs. We calculate the kW for\nlong-term storage and assume 1000 hours of storage per kW.\n\n##### Short-term storage\n\nShort-term storage in CPAT is satisfied by the batteries. Total storage\nneeds are calculated in hours, which means kWh of storage per kW of\naverage generation (not peak capacity).\n\nThe model uses rounded versions of a parameterization derived from\nglobal data[^3_27]. The model assumes that the total number of storage\nfor a 100% VRE system is 9 hours, with a quadratic form. We fit the\nshort-term storage needed (in hours) as a (conservative) quadratic\nfunction of the VRE. We allocate some percentage of this (currently\n100%) to the costs of the power system itself. VRE, $v$, includes\nsolar and wind but not hydro (other renewables are neglected).\nShort-term storage $\\text{sst}$ is measured in hours,\ni.e. kWh/(kWh/h). We also assume a ratio between the kWh of the storage\nand the kw interface. For conservatism (given our metric is in kWh), we\nuse a low number (2 hours) for the ratio of kWh to kw:\n\n$\\text{sst} = 9v^{2}$\n\nBy way of example, for a 50% VRE system, the hours needed are\n$9*{0.5}^{2} = 2.25$ hours.\n\nTherefore, the marginal storage needed is:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{dsst}}{\\text{dv}} = 18v^{2}$\n\nThe system has assumed to already have invested optimally in the\nexisting storage at current VRE.\n\n##### Long-term storage\n\nCPAT also has a long-term storage model. Long-term storage is additional\nto short-term storage and is measured according to the cost of the\ninterface (i.e., the electrolyzers rather than the cost of the storage\ntank). The interface is measured in units of KW. Therefore the\nproportion of long-term storage per kW of average generation is measured\nin dimensionless terms (kW per kW or %).\n\nLong term storage $\\text{slt}$ costs are treated as effectively\npunitively costly (in contrast to short term storage), reflecting\ncurrent costs and technological uncertainties. The long-term storage\nmodel assumes zero need for long-term storage below a VRE penetration of\n75 percent, raising to 100 percent at a VRE of 100 percent. To this end,\nlong-term storage is viewed as additional to short-term storage, and is\nneeded for VRE over 75%.\n\nSince batteries and hydrogen have other uses, we also have a parameter\nthat determines the proportion of the short-term and long-term storage\nallocated to the electricity system. This is set to 100% for short-term\nstorage and 33% for long-term storage. This parameter can be modified in\nthe dashboard:\n\n![](./03/media/image31.png)\n\nFigure 3‑24: Dashboard: Percent allocation of LT storage costs to VRE\n\nGiven its interseasonal storage and geographic independence, we focus on\nthe costs of electrolysers for storage. This storage cost is thus\nassumed as a long-term storage and is measured with the interface\n(i.e. electrolysers) as the numeraire. It is given by the following\nquadratic function:\n\n$\\text{slt} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n0 & \\text{for\\ }v \\leq 0.75 \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{v - 0.75}{1 - 0.75} \\right)^{2} & \\text{for\\ }v > 0.75 \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $\n\nLong term storage requirements are measured in MW/MW, i.e. dimensionless\nunits (%). The marginal MW of electrolysers required once VRE\npenetration reaches 75% is thus varying according to the derivative\n$2*\\frac{v - 0.75}{\\left( 1 - 0.75 \\right)^{2}}$. The table below\nshows the results for different levels of VRE.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>VRE penetration</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Marginal MW of electrolyzers required</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>85%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>2.5</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>90%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>5.0</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>95%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>7.5</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>100%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>10.0</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n##### Levelized cost of storage\n\nThe levelized cost of the marginal quantity of storage needed to\nmaintain required quantities of total storage is added to the investment\ncosts for VRE. This means that the storage-inclusive cost of renewables\ncan rise in time as renewable penetrations increase, even if the cost of\nrenewables without storage is falling.\n\n### Elasticity model\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe elasticity-based model is derived from an IMF spreadsheet tool, with\na methodology described in an IMF board paper[^3_28]. The CPAT mitigation\nmodule, and the IMF tool on which it is based, are primarily\nelasticity-based models, meaning that future fuel demand is dependent on\nprojected total real GDP growth, and upon future energy prices, modified\nby mitigation policies such as carbon taxes. The power supply model is\nalso based on elasticities, although it has a more complex structure\nthan in other sectors. It separately models final power demand, and\nwithin that overall power demand the generation share of different\ngeneration types.\n\n#### Notation\n\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name\nof the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are\nreported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made\nto ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n| **Notation**                 | **Variable**                                                                                   | **Unit** |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| $E$                        | Total quantity of power demanded by sector                                                     | GWh      |\n| $Y$                        | Total real GDP                                                                                 | US$      |\n| $p$                        | Retail price                                                                                   | US$/Gj   |\n| $\\alpha$                   | Autonomous annual energy efficiency improvement                                                | %        |\n| $\\Psi$                     | Covid adjustment factor to energy demand                                                       | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{Y}$             | Forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand                                             | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{U}$             | Elasticity of usage of energy products and services                                            | %        |\n| $\\epsilon_{F}$             | Efficiency price elasticity                                                                    | %        |\n| $g$                        | electricity generation                                                                         | GWh      |\n| $\\Phi$                     | Production share                                                                               | %        |\n| $\\text{gn}c^{*}$           | Total unit cost adjusted of thermal efficiency                                                 | US$/kWh  |\n| $\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}$ | Conditional own-price elasticity of generation from fuel $f$ with respect to generation cost | %        |\n| $\\delta^{\\text{add}}$      | Additional share of electricity generation attributed to non-nuclear and non-hydro energy      | %        |\n| $\\text{TotExcess}$         | Total surplus of nuclear and hydro power generation to be redistributed                        | %        |\n| $F$                        | Use of fuel                                                                                    | ktoe     |\n\n#### Generation costs\n\nImportantly, by default, the power generation costs are taken from the\nengineer model (i.e. levelized fixed cost plus current variable costs,\nbut excluding intangible coal cost). However, this assumption can be\nmodified and the cost model from the IMF board paper can, if wished, be\nselected in the dashboard. The methodology for these ‘old’ costs is\ngiven the IMF paper mentioned above.\n\n![Figure 49: Dashboard: Use Spot Fuel Prices in Engineer Power\nModel](./03/media/image32.png)\n\nFigure 3‑25: Dashboard: Use old or new generation costs in elasticity\nmodel\n\nRenewable producer subsidies under a baseline scenario, as well as under\nthe policy scenario, can be specified in the dashboard:\n\n![](./03/media/image33.png)\n\nFigure 3‑26: Dashboard: Renewable producer subsidies under a baseline\nscenario\n\n#### Total power demand\n\nAs described above, power demand is determined by the energy use\nequation. As this is a total power demand, elasticities are averaged\nacross all sectors. The autonomous efficiency improvements (or more\nespecially, the annual generation productivity improvements) used across\nfuels are as follows:\n\n| Fuels            | Change |\n| ---------------- | ------ |\n| Coal             | 0.5%   |\n| Natural gas      | 1.0%   |\n| Oil              | 0.5%   |\n| Nuclear          | 1.0%   |\n| Wind             | 5.0%   |\n| Solar            | 5.0%   |\n| Hydro            | 1.0%   |\n| Other renewables | 5.0%   |\n| Biomass          | 1.0%   |\n\nProductivity improvements at power plants reflect improvements in\ntechnical efficiency and gradual retirement of older, less efficient\nplants. Following the IMF Board Paper, for coal, annual average\nproductivity growth is taken to be 0.5 percent based on IEA’s data. For\nnatural gas, nuclear, and hydro, there is likely a bit more room for\nproductivity improvements and baseline annual growth rate of 1 percent\nis assumed. For renewables, a productivity growth rate of 5 percent is\nused (i.e., costs halve every 15 years).\n\nFor the base year, energy consumption is extracted from energy balances,\nexpressed as total energy consumption net of fuel transformation and\ntransportation. The index $E$ denotes the sector Electricity.\n\nFor 2020, estimates are based on the previous year’s data adjusted for a\none-time exogenous shock, i.e., Covid (see Section 3.3.4.4).\n\n$\\frac{E_{\\text{oct}}}{E_{\\text{oc},t - 1}} = \\left( 1 + \\alpha \\right)^{- \\left( 1 + \\epsilon_{U} \\right)}\\left( 1 + 0.5*\\Psi_{\\text{ct}} \\right)\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{cEt}}}{p_{\\text{cE},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{U,\\text{cE}}}\\left( \\frac{p_{\\text{cEt}}}{p_{\\text{cE},t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{F,\\text{cE}}}\\left( \\frac{Y_{\\text{ct}}}{Y_{c,t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{G,\\text{cE}}}$\n\nIn the elasticity model, half the usual Covid adjustment is employed as\npower demand does not fall as far as other energy types.\n\n#### Total power supply\n\nPower generation fuels potentially include coal, natural gas, oil,\nnuclear, hydro, biomass wind, solar and other renewables.\n\nSimilar to the engineer model, total demand is scaled to generation\n(which includes additionally transmission losses, energy industry own\nuse and transmission losses). The total production of electricity,\n$g_{\\text{oct}}$, is driven by the total power demand multiplied by\nthe ratio of generation to demand in the base year.\n\n$g_{\\text{oct}} = E_{\\text{oct}}*\\frac{g_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}}{E_{\\text{oc},t_{0}}}$\n\nFor the base year, total electricity generation is based on observed\nenergy balance data, which is the sum of all electricity generation from\neach fuel $f$.\n\nThe elasticity model provides two types of information when it comes to\nforecast generation of each type of fuel: the electricity output and the\nprimary energy used for electricity production for each technology.\n\n**The electricity output** from technology $f$ is defined as the\nproduction share multiplied the total production. The production share,\n$\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}}$ is derived from observed data and is defined as\nthe ratio between the observed electricity output from fuel $f$ and\nthe total production, that is\n$\\frac{g_{\\text{ocft}}}{g_{\\text{oct}}}$. The production share is\nassumed to be fixed until 2020. After this date, to accommodate flexible\nassumptions for the degree of substitution among fuels, the share of\nfuel $f$ in generation is defined as:\n\n$\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}} = \\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\left( \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}} + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\sum_{i \\neq f}^{}\\left\\lbrack 1 - \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocit}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{oci},t - 1}^{*}} \\right\\rbrack^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}}}{\\sum_{j \\neq f}^{}\\Phi_{\\text{ocj},t - 1}}$\n\nwhere $i$ and $j$ are bound variables ranging over the same range as\n$f$ (i.e., OIL, NGA, COA, NUC, WND, SOL, BIO, REN, HYD). In addition,\n$\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}$ denotes the total unit cost adjusted of\nthermal efficiency and $\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}} < 0$ is the\nconditional own-price elasticity of generation from fuel $f$ with\nrespect to generation cost. Conditional (indicated by $\\\\tilde$) here\nmeans the elasticity reflects the percent reduction in use of fuel $f$\ndue to switching from that fuel to other generation fuels, per\none-percent increase in generation cost for fuel $f$, holding total\nelectricity generation fixed. Generation cost elasticities are larger\nthan corresponding fuel price elasticities as an incremental increase in\nfuel and non-fuel generation costs has a bigger impact than an\nincremental increase in fuel costs alone.\n\nFrom the above equation, fuel $f$’s generation share decreases in own\ngeneration cost. It also increases in the generation cost of fuel\n$i \\neq f$, where the increase in fuel $f$’s generation share is the\nreduced share fuel $i$ (i.e., $\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}}$ times the term in\nsquare brackets) multiplied by the (initial) share of fuel $f$ in\ngeneration from all fuel alternatives to $i$ (i.e.,\n$\\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}}{\\sum_{f \\neq i}^{}\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}}$:\n\nNB: The actual equation in CPAT also reflects that nuclear and hydro\nshould normally not grow beyond current levels. Therefore the model\nreallocates any excess growth for nuclear and hydro to other generation\ntypes. The equation above thus becomes:\n\n$\\Phi_{\\text{ocft}} = \\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\left( \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}} + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}\\sum_{f \\neq i}^{}\\left\\lbrack 1 - \\iota_{\\text{cft}} \\right\\rbrack^{\\epsilon_{\\widetilde{E}}}}{\\sum_{f \\neq i}^{}\\Phi_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}}*\\delta^{\\text{add}}$\n\nwhere\n$\\iota_{\\text{cft}} = \\frac{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}^{*}}{\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}^{*}}$\nand\n$\\delta_{\\text{oct}}^{\\text{add}} = \\frac{\\text{TotExces}s_{\\text{oc},\\text{NUC} + \\text{HYD},t}}{\\left( 1 - \\Phi_{\\text{oc},\\text{HYD},t} - \\Phi_{\\text{oc},\\text{NUC},t} \\right)}$\n\n**The energy used of each technology** $f$ **in electricity\nproduction**\n\nSimilarly, to electricity output, the base year corresponds to observed\ndata, with the exception of wind, hydropower, solar and other renewables\nwhich are equal to electricity output. Therefore, for the following\nyears, the energy used in electricity production is expressed as\nfollows:\n\n$F_{\\text{ocft}} = E_{\\text{ocft}}*\\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha_{f}} \\right)^{t}\\frac{F_{\\text{ocf},0}}{E_{\\text{ocf},0}}$\n\nThe fuel use is equal to the electricity generated multiplied by an\nefficiency improvement over time $\\alpha_{f}$ specific to the\ngeneration type $f$.\n\n###  Power data sources and parameter choices\n\n\n#### Overview\n\n##### Sources\n\nThe section presents the data sources and the methodology to estimate\nthe different characteristics of the power sector. In particular, is it\nfirst important to present the data and explain how consistency is\nensured across the different data sources. The remainder of the section\nfocuses on the methodology employed to estimate the power sector\ncharacteristics.\n\nIn the mitigation module, and in particular in the power sector, CPAT\nrelies on several characteristics presented in the section below, along\nwith their definition.\n\nThe table below presents the different data sources used to estimate\npower plant characteristics.\n\nTable 3‑7: Power characteristics and data sources\n\n![Figure 51: Data mapping and description of data\nsources](./03/media/image34.png)\n\nAs presented above, CPAT relies on various data sources which provide\nproject-based data, that is:\n\n  - IRENA (IRENA, 2020): The IRENA Renewable Cost Database contains cost\n    and performance data for around 17 000 renewable power generation\n    projects across the world with a total capacity of more than 1,770\n    GW.\n  - IEA\\&NEA (IEA\\&NEA, 2020): The database covers 243 plants in 24\n    countries.\n  - EIA (EIA, 2021): Data were collected on the status of existing\n    electric generating plants and projects scheduled for initial\n    commercial operation within 5 or 10 years in the United States and\n    Puerto Rico.\n  - Enerdata: The tool provides data power generation assets in around\n    150 countries throughout the world based on 7800 operating projects\n    or projects under development.\n  - JRC (Ioannis Tsiropoulos et al., 2018): Based on confidential,\n    project-based European data from 2015, the authors provide forecast\n    estimates of investment costs.\n  - Breyer (Bogdanov et al., 2019): This study bases its global\n    estimations on various above-mentioned sources. In particular, the\n    authors rely mainly on IEA\\&NEA for renewable data and BNEF for\n    non-renewable data to forecast some characteristics. The authors\n    provide data for the years 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045\n    and 2050.\n  - NREL: Cole et al. (2021) and Augustine & Blair (2021) provide\n    historical as well as forecast data for utility-scale battery\n    storage costs in the United-States. The former article’s data and\n    estimates are based on a survey of 18 studies, including sources\n    mentioned above. Cole et al. (2021) update their work on a yearly\n    basis. Cole et al. (2021) is the latest update. The latter study\n    based their projection costs on BNEF data, which provide learning\n    rates and deployment projections for utility-scale battery. Another\n    advantage of relying on BNEF data lies in the provision of data on\n    component of batteries.\n\n##### Data approach for the power prices and ‘Engineer’ power model\n\nThe power models have important data requirements. There are two main\ntypes of data sources: first (method one), we have components that are\ndirectly from, or derived from, energy consumption data and energy\ncapacity data; second (method two), we have components that come from\nstudies.\n\nTwo crucial quantities use a combination of data sources: thermal\nefficiency and capacity factor.\n\n**Method 1: Energy Consumption, capacity data, and derived data**\n\nThere are three primary energy consumption datasets used: electricity\ngeneration (in GWh), by generation type, fuel use (in ktoe), and\nelectrical capacity (in MW). Before beginning, all three energy sources\nare converted to a consistent unit, MW, equivalent to MWy per year.\n\nThermal efficiency is calculated thus:\n\n$\\nu_{\\text{cf}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{cf},t_{0}}}{F_{\\text{cEf},t_{0}}}$\n\nFor coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, and biomass, where\n$F_{\\text{ocEf},t_{0}}$ is the fuel f used for the generation of\nelectricity $g_{\\text{ocf},t_{0}}$[^3_29]$,$ in the base year,\nbaseline scenario. For solar, wind, hydro, and other renewables,\nefficiency is set by convention to 1. As mentioned before, we use Net\nCalorific Values exclusively.\n\nIf efficiency is less than a certain level, currently set to be 10%, we\nuse the best data from studies rather than derived efficiencies. Note\nthe efficiencies are not ‘floored’ in this case but instead set to be\nequal to the study data.\n\nCapacity data are taken from EIA, except for fossil fuel types which are\ntaken from the EIA all-fossil average and then descaled using estimated\nproportions calculated by CPAT from other sources.\n\nCapacity factors are derived in a similar way\n\n$cf_{\\text{cf}} = \\frac{g_{\\text{cf},t_{0}}}{\\text{ca}p_{\\text{cf},t_{0}}}$\n\nThese data are used in CPAT unless they are outside specific ranges set\nin the dashboard.\n\n**Method 2: Components derived from studies**\n\nTo compute cost, specific disaggregated prices and other components\n(e.g., lifetime) data by technology and sometimes by country are used.\nInput data are derived as averages of EIA, IEA & NEA, IRENA, JRC (EU),\nBodganov, et al., and NREL data.\n\nThese averages are made by country, region and world, with selected\nstudy data chosen by country, region then world according to data\navailability. Note that the asia region does not include China, Japan\nand (South) Korea, because of widely different costs compared to the\nregional average.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the different sources,\nmethodology unit and coverage for each data type employed in the\nengineer power model:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Data section</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Unit</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Data level</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Data source</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Main parameters</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Simple averages of available data points are computed.

In other words, the amount of\nenergy input that is transformed into work output can be computed\nthrough the thermal efficiency: $\\varphi = \\frac{W}{Q_{I}}$. Thermal\nefficiency is comprised between 0 and 100%. For instance, if 200 joules\nof thermal energy are input ($Q_{I}$), and the engine transforms this\nenergy into 80 joules, the efficiency rate is 40%. In the United-States,\nthe heat rate is widely spread and is expressed in British Thermal Units\n(BTU). One BTU is equivalent to roughly 1055 joules and 2.93E-4 kWh.\n\n![](./03/media/image35.png)\n\nFigure 3‑27: Data mapping and description of data sources\n\nThere are two ways of calculating thermal efficiency, that is in **net\nor gross calorific value**. Calorific value is an essential parameter to\nspecify the energetic content of different materials. **Net calorific\nvalue (or low heating value)** subtracts the heat of vaporization of the\nwater from the gross calorific value, while the **gross calorific value\n(or high heating value)** is the total amount of heat produced from the\ncomplete combustion of a unit of a substance. It is essential to verify\nwhether the efficiency is net or gross because the difference can be\nabout 5% to 6% of the gross value for solid and liquid fuels, and about\n10% for natural gas.\n\nFor instance, in a gas power plant, let’s say that to produce 1kWh of\nelectricity, 3kWh of natural gas in gross calorific value (GCV) is\nnecessary. The net calorific value (NCV) can be derived from the gross\ncalorific value by using a factor of 0.9 (Eurostat et al., 2004).\nConsequently, in NCV, 2.7kWh are necessary to produce 1kWh. The thermal\nefficiency is therefore equivalent to $\\frac{1}{3} = 33\\%$ in GCV and\n$\\frac{1}{2.7} = 37\\%$ in NCV or, equivalently, the thermal efficiency\nin GVC corresponds to the thermal efficiency in NVC to which the\nconversion rate is applied: $37\\% \\times 0.9 = 33\\%$. The conversion\nrate fluctuates with the fuel used but also the technology used.\nFinally, the heat rate is often expressed in British thermal units (BTU)\nper net kWh generated. To express the efficiency of a generator or power\nplant as a percentage, it is essential to divide the equivalent BTU\ncontent of a kWh of electricity (3,412 BTU) by the heat rate.\n\nThe **capacity factor** measures the frequency of operation of a power\nplant during a given period. It is expressed as a percentage and is\ncalculated by dividing the unit’s actual power output by the maximum\npossible output. This ratio indicates how much of a unit’s capacity is\nbeing used.\n\n#### Consistency across data sources\n\nThe simple average of the data sources is used to construct our dataset\nof electricity sector characteristics. Nevertheless, faced with\ndifferent approaches, we first analyze the underlying assumptions of\neach data source and performed a few adjustments to build a consistent\napproach. The table below outlines the different assumptions underlying\nthe construction of variables in the power sector according to various\ndata sources and correction is CPAT. Green cells indicates that no\nadjustments have been made, whereas orange cells provide adjustments\nmade in CPAT. As the study of Bogdanov et al. (2019) is based on the\ndata sources listed in the table, it is not incorporated in the table.\n\nTable 3‑8: Assumption underlying the construction of power data\n\n![Figure 53: Assumption underlying the construction of power\ndata](./03/media/image36.png)\n\nAs the various data sources rely on disparate assumptions under a few\naspects, adjustments are made to build a consistent database to be fed\ninto CPAT. As such, the following adjustments are performed.\n\n**Costs in time**: The latest version of CPAT relies on data in 2019. As\ncosts in time may vary depending on status of the power plant\n(e.g. operational, under construction, authorized, etc.), the retained\napproach first aims at building time series based on the available data\npoints in time across the different data sources. Longest time series\nspan from 1983 to 2040. While all sources focus on operational power\nplants or in the pipeline for commissioning after 2019, Enerdata\nconsiders a multitude of statuses, including cancelled or announced\nprojects. Therefore, we filter the status of the plants and select only\nplants that are operational until 2020. From 2021 to 2040, only\nannounced and authorized projects, power plants under construction and\nPPA signed are considered in the construction of time series. In the\ncase of Bogdanov et al. (2019), which provide data every five years\n(i.e. starting from 2015), estimates for the year 2019 are approximated\nusing the following weighting approach:\n$\\text{CAPE}X_{2019} = 0.2 \\times \\text{CAPE}X_{2015} + 0.8 \\times \\text{CAPE}X_{2020}$.\n\n**Overnight costs**: Capital costs are in principle excluding interest\npayments during construction time. However, IRENA Renewable Cost\ndatabase provides total installed costs, namely including overnight\ncosts. To adjust data from overnight costs, two information are needed:\n\n  - The construction time ($n_{\\text{cons}}$) data for each renewable\n    technology. This information is derived from both EIA and IEA\\&NEA.\n    The average of the two sources of information is used as in the\n    table below.\n  - The weighted average cost of capital (*wacc*). Following Steffen\n    (2020), the WACC is roughly 7.5% for OECD countries and 10% for\n    non-OECD countries. We thus apply the following rates:\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p>Income Level</p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p>WACC Assumed</p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>HIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p><strong>7.5%</strong></p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>UMIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p><strong>10.0%</strong></p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>LMIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p><strong>12.5%</strong></p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>LIC</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p><strong>15.0%</strong></p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n  - Finally, the following formula is used to subtract overnight costs:\n    $\\frac{\\text{CapE}x_{\\text{IRENA}}}{\\left( 1 + \\text{wacc} \\right)_{\\text{cons}}^{n}}$.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Average time (year) for construction</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Biomass</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>4.0</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Solar (Utility-scale PV)</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>1.5</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Geothermal power</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>4.5</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Hydropower</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>4.5</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>On-shore wind</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>2.0</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n**Costs are in USD and real (i.e. net of inflation)**: Only BNEF\ndatabase displays nominal data. Monetary data are thus adjusted based on\nthe US GDP deflator indicator. In the case of JRC and Breyer, data are\nreal but denominated in EUR. The 2019 average EUR/US exchange rate is\napplied.\n\n**Efficiency in Net Calorific Value**: The differences between net and\ngross calorific values are typically about 5% to 6% of the gross value\nfor solid and liquid fuels, and about 10% for natural gas. Therefore,\nbased on the original (GCV) data from BNEF, we approximate the NCV by\napplying a 10% increase for natural gas and 5.5% for the other\ntechnologies considered on the GCV values.\n\n**Lifetime assumptions**: Lifetime information is given for all types of\ntechnologies considered in CPAT except for biomass. A lifetime of 35\nyears for power plants specialized in biomass is supposed.\n\n#### Estimation of the power sector characteristics\n\nTo estimate power sector characteristics in 2019, simple averages of\navailable data points are computed. In the first stage, in order not to\noverweight one data source over another, the averages are calculated by\ndata source, as a data source may provide different data at a given time\nand for the same technology because data are project-based. In a second\nstep, the calculation of averages is deployed in the following order of\npriority: by country, by CPAT region[^3_30], and globally. More\nspecifically, to construct a dataset for the year 2019:\n\n  - CapEx is estimated based on 2019 data points only; 2019 is retained\n    as a commissioning year for power plants.\n  - For Fixed and Variable OpEx, Efficiency and Capacity Factor, due to\n    data limitation, closest trends are included (i.e. the average\n    includes estimates for plants commissioning between 2015 and 2025).\n    This approach is reasonable because these variables do not vary\n    greatly from year to year.\n\n**Forecasting CAPEX**: In the case of wind and solar, we use the\nlearning curve method to forecast global CAPEX from 2023 to 2050. The\nunderlying idea is to highlight the cross-country transferability of a\ncountry's learning effects. For wind and solar only, we use capacity\nprojections from the IEA Stated Policy (STEPS)[^3_31] and Net Zero\n(NZE)[^3_32] scenarios, then experience Parameters extracted from Way et\nal., 2022[^3_33].\n\nWe set the values of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 of wind and solar global\nCAPEX equal to the 2019 values.\n\nFollowing the work of JRC (see Tsiropoulos et al., 2018), the learning\ncurve method to forecast CAPEX for renewable energies different of wind\nand solar from 2023 to 2040[^3_34] is applied to each CPAT region, China,\nJapan, Korea[^3_35] and worldwide. The other technologies, i.e. coal,\noil, natural gas, and nuclear, are not subject to a learning rate nor to\ndifferent scenarios and are assumed to be constant over time.\n\nThe learning rate method is commonly employed to estimate development of\ncosts over time and holds the advantage of being relatively easy to\nmeasure. With specific learning rate to technologies, this approach\nindicates the price reduction of the considered technology (i.e. the\nperformance indicator) arising from every doubling of cumulative\ninstalled capacity (experience rate). Experience does not cause costs to\ndrop directly. While it is believed to be correlated to changes in the\nproduction process (e.g. R\\&D, technical innovation, economies of scale\nor labor productivity) or the product itself (e.g. design), the model\ndoes not identify the factor of cost reduction. More sophisticated\nmodels such as the component-based learning cost, multi-factor learning\ncurve (Rubin et al., 2015) or approach based on probabilistic cost\nforecasting methods (Way et al., 2021).\n\nCost reduction in time, accounting for the performance and experience\nindicators, is expressed by:\n\n$\\text{Cos}t_{t} = \\text{Cos}t_{0}\\left( \\frac{\\text{Ca}p_{t}}{\\text{Ca}p_{0}} \\right)^{\\left( - \\varepsilon \\right)}$\n\nwhere $\\text{Cos}t_{t}$ is the unit cost of the considered technology\nin year $t$ after the deployment of cumulative installed capacity of\n$\\text{Ca}p_{t}$ unit. Similarly, $\\text{Cos}t_{0}$ stands for CapEx\nin year 0 at cumulative deployment capacity of $\\text{Ca}p_{0}$ unit.\n$\\varepsilon$ denotes the experience parameter. The learning rate\n($\\text{LR}$) is thus:\n\n$\\text{LR} = 1 - 2^{\\varepsilon}$\n\nwhere the parameter $2^{\\varepsilon}$ is known as the learning rate\nratio or progress ratio and reflects the slope of the learning curve.\n\nIn the case of wind and solar, we consider four different\nscenarios[^3_36]:\n\n  - The **low scenario**: we use the IEA STEPS scenario for capacity\n    projections data, and a low learning rate parameter (equal to mean –\n    standard deviation ; 0.276 for Solar, 0.153 for Wind)\n\n  - The **medium scenario**: we use the IEA STEPS scenario for capacity\n    projections data, and a medium learning rate parameter (0.319 for\n    Solar, 0.194 for Wind)\n\n  - The **high scenario**: we use the IEA NZE scenario for capacity\n    projections data, and a medium learning rate parameter (0.319 for\n    Solar, 0.194 for Wind)\n\n  - The **very high scenario**: we use the IEA NZE scenario for capacity\n    projections data, and a high learning rate parameter (equal to mean\n    + standard deviation ; 0.362 for Solar, 0.235 for Wind)\n\nSimilarly, to JRC for renewables other than wind and solar, the approach\ntaken is built around three scenarios:\n\n  - The **low scenario** is associated with a 0.5% increase of the\n    installed capacity. A low scenario covers a low renewable supply\n    energy deployment and reflects a baseline scenario;\n\n  - The **medium scenario** is associated with a 1% increase of the\n    installed capacity and corresponds to a mid-range deployment of\n    renewable energy supply;\n\n  - The **high scenario** is associated with a 2.5% increase of the\n    installed capacity and mirrors high ambitious in terms of additional\n    capacity installed of renewable energy supply; and\n\n  - The **very high scenario** is associated with a 4% increase of the\n    installed capacity. Such an increase reflects an ambitious uptake of\n    renewable energy supply accompanied by ambitious policies.\n\nThe learning rates employed is from JRC, as well as from authors’ own\nassumptions (in particular for the high/very high scenario) and are\ndescribed in the below table for both technologies and for all\nscenarios. The learning rate does not vary across time.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Scenarios</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Biomass</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Geothermal Power</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hydropower</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Solar</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Wind</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Low</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.020</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.020</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.00</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.10</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.020</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Medium</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.050</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.050</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.01</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.20</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.050</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>High</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.075</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.075</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.02</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.23</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.075</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Very high</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.100</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.100</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.05</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.25</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>0.100</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nThe first equation is then applied for the different scenarios and\ntechnologies described in the table above with $\\text{Cos}t_{0}$ and\n$\\text{Ca}p_{0}$ being CapEx and installed capacity for the year 2022,\nrespectively, and $\\text{Ca}p_{t}$ standing for the forecast installed\ncapacity for the year the CapEx is estimated ($\\text{Cos}t_{t}$).\n\nFinally, renewable technologies are more metals and minerals than\nnon-renewables[^3_37] hence rising metals/minerals costs can be expected\nto increase the relative cost of new renewables investment. Considering\nthe surge in international metals and mineral prices in 2021-2,\nprojected capital expenditure costs for investment in new renewable and\nnon-renewable capacity were therefore upscaled. Metals and all other\ncommodities are expected to increase by about 2 times in 2022-3[^3_38]\ncompared to 2020 levels and assuming that these primary inputs into\nrenewables account for roughly one tenth of the total of renewables\nup-front investment costs, which are themselves about 75% of total costs\nfor renewables,[^3_39] the increase of CapEx for renewables would be\nabout 15% in 2022-3 compared to 2020. However, as a part of this\nincrease might be captured in 2020-1 data, the CapEx increase in new\nrenewable and non-renewable capacity was upscaled by 10% and 5% in 2022\nrespectively, declining to a 5% and 2.5% permanent increase in 2030\ncompared with previous projections.\n\n**Storage costs**: Utility-scale battery storage systems differ slightly\nfrom other technologies as they store produced electricity by generators\nor pulled from the electric grid. These systems then redistribute the\npower based on the demands. It is worth noting that battery storage\ncosts are commonly expressed in kWh, although one fraction of these\ncosts, the power costs, are measured in kW. We follow Feldman et\nal. (2020) and express the costs of battery as follows:\n$\\text{TotalCost}\\left( \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{kWh}} \\right) = \\text{EnergyCost}\\left( \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{kWh}} \\right) + \\text{PowerCost}\\left( \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{kW}} \\right)/(\\text{Duration}\\left( \\text{hr} \\right)$\n\nSeveral types of battery exist, typically varying from 1h to 4h storage\nbattery. In CPAT, costs for battery correspond to 2h storage battery.\nForecast storage costs are based on the work of Cole et al. (2021) and\nAugustine & Blair (2021)[^3_40]. The authors base their estimations on\ncurrent literature and data for Li-Ion Battery Storage, 60 MW, 240 MWh\nstorage (4 hours) in the United-States are used as representative data.\nCosts for 2h storage battery are then estimated based on the above\nformula and expressed in kW[^3_41]. In particular, all values are given\nin 2019 U.S. dollars, using the Consumer Price Index (BLS, 2020) for\ndollar year conversions. Projections use an inflation assumption of 2.5%\nper year. In the same vein as for wind and solar, three scenarios are\ndeveloped. The low, middle and high scenarios correspond to the minimum,\nmedian and maximum points, respectively. Augustine & Blair (2021)\nfollows the approach in Cole et al. (2021), where data points between\n2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050 are derived from a linear interpolation.\n\n**Decommissioning costs**: Decommissioning takes place after a power\nplant retires. Notably, retirement and decommissioning are different.\nRetirement indicates that the plant is no longer producing electricity,\nbut assets such as buildings, turbines, boilers or other equipment are\nleft on site. The decommissioning process refers to dismantlement,\nenvironmental remediation and restoration of the site. While much of the\nliterature focuses on decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants,\ndata on decommissioning costs for other types of technology are scant.\nThe following data sources are used in CPAT:\n\n  - Raimi (2017) provides estimates on decommissioning costs per type of\n    technologies (offshore and onshore wind, coal, concentrated solar,\n    solar PV and petroleum and gas) based on a survey of the literature.\n    Data are expressed at 2016 U.S. dollar prices;\n  - OECD\\&NEA (2016) presents data on nuclear power plant\n    decommissioning costs based on surveys answered by nuclear power\n    plants located in Europe. Data are expressed at 2013 U.S. dollar\n    prices;\n  - Duke Energy Corporation[^3_42] is a nuclear power plant that\n    submitted information to the US authority on the cost of\n    decommissioning. Data are expressed at 2017 U.S. dollar prices; and\n  - Water Power & Dam construction[^3_43] estimates, based on information\n    on dam destruction in the United-States, that decommissioning costs\n    can be 20-40% of new construction costs.\n\nIn CPAT, decommissioning costs are expressed as a percentage of global\nupfront costs. To this purpose, for nuclear, estimates retrieved from\nthese studies are averaged. The ratio of the available data for\ndecommissioning costs to the global CapEx (US/MW) data by technology\ntype, are then used to express decommissioning costs as a percentage of\nCapEx. For natural gas, the average between estimated decommissioning\ncosts for petroleum and gas (various types) is used as decommissioning\ncosts. For hydropower, based on the above-mentioned study, it is assumed\nthat decommissioning costs amount to 20% of CapEx.\n\n#### References\n\n1.  Andrade, J., & Baldick, R. (2017).

Note that the\n    mitigation also presents short-lived air pollutants\n    (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NOx, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NMVOC, BC,\n    OC, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO); the methodology for these is covered in\n    the air pollution module documentation.\n  - \n  - **Sectors**: Energy-related sectors (i.e., Transport, Power,\n    Industry, Building, and Other energy use), as well as\n    non-energy-related sectors (i.e., Agriculture, Industrial Process,\n    LULUCF, Waste and Other). It is important to note that some parts of\n    the sectors accounted for in the non-energy sectors are also\n    reflected in energy-related sectors. For instance, Agriculture also\n    appears under the ‘Building’ sector, under ‘Food and Forestry’\n    sub-sector (for more information, see Appendix B). \n\nCPAT considers territorial rather than consumption-based emissions. This\nmeans that, for example, if some natural gas is imported but subject to\nleaks upstream in extraction before it arrives at the country concerned,\nthese methane emissions are not counted in the emissions of a natural\ngas power station. However, an extracting country will include those\nleaks. Similarly, the emissions from imported goods are not included,\nwhereas those associated with exported goods are included.\n\nIn what follows, we first define the role of emission factors and their\nsources. Second, we present the approach adopted for energy-related\n$_{}$ and non- $_{}$ by fuel and sector. Third, we describe the\nestimation of emissions in non-energy sectors. We use the index $p$ to\nrefer to the type of GHG ($CO_{2}$, $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$ and\nF-gases). The variable $em_{\\text{ocupt}}$ denotes the estimation of\nemissions under scenario $o$, country $c$, UNFCC sector $u$ , and\nfor pollutant $p$ and at year $t$. Total GHG emissions are the sum\nof both energy and non-energy related emissions:\n$em_{\\text{oc},\\text{GHG},t} = em_{\\text{ocER},\\text{GHG},t} + em_{\\text{ocNER},\\text{GHG},t}$.\nFinally, the section explains how NDCs are accounted for in CPAT.\n\n### Notation\n\nThe table below presents the notations used in the section and the name\nof the variables to which they correspond. Note that the units are\nreported as they were input into CPAT, but further conversions are made\nto ensure that they match our calculations.\n\n| **Notation**                   | **Variable**                                       | **Unit**                                     |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| $\\text{em}$                  | Emissions                                          | $\\text{tC}O_{2}$/GJ                        |\n| $\\text{Δe}m_{\\text{LUCF},t}$ | LULUCF emissions decline                           | % per annual in absolute value of start year |\n| $\\text{ef}$                  | Emission factors                                   | $\\text{tC}O_{2}$/ktoe                      |\n| $F$                          | Use of fuel                                        | ktoe                                         |\n| $\\text{fug}$                 | Methane fugitive and venting emissions             | $\\text{tC}O_{2}$/ktoe                      |\n| $\\text{gwp}$                 | Global warming potential from methane emissions    | $\\text{tC}O_{2}$/ktoe                      |\n| $Y_{\\text{grow}}$            | GDP growth                                         | %                                            |\n| $lp_{\\text{grow}}$           | Population growth                                  | %                                            |\n| $\\text{ame}$                 | Additional (e.g. non-pricing) mitigation effort    | %                                            |\n| $\\epsilon_{Y}$               | Forward-looking real GDP-elasticity of fuel demand | %                                            |\n| $\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}$       | Population elasticity                              | %                                            |\n\n### Emission factors\n\nAn emission factor is a coefficient that converts activity data into GHG\nemissions. It represents the average emission rate for a given fuel\nrelative to consumption units. For instance, in the power sector, coal\nemits 3.931 ton of $_{}$ per ktoe.\n\nThe emission factors used are (as a default) fuel-, country- and\nsector-specific emissions from IIASA’s GAINS model[^3_44]. The user also\nhas the option to use global emissions factors from the IEA.[^3_45] The\nemission factors given by the IEA are scaled at a worldwide level, while\nthose from IIASA are country specific. Also, IIASA emission factors\ninclude process and fugitive emissions in the distribution network from\nnatural gas (which is why it is necessary to rescale them through the\noverall calibration to 2019 emissions). All emission factors are sector\nand fuel specific.\n\nThe user has the possibility in the dashboard to select the source of\nemission factors to be used. Global IEA emissions factors are also an\noption.\n\n![Figure 63: Selection of the source of emission\nfactors](./03/media/image37.png)\n\nFigure 3‑28: Selection of the source of emission factors\n\nThe emissions are given originally in\n$\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{GJ}}$, then converted in\n$\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{ktoe}}$ via a $\\text{ktoe}$ to\n$\\text{GJ}$ conversion factor of $41,868$.\n\n$ef_{\\text{cgf},\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{ktoe}}} = ef_{\\text{cgf},\\frac{\\text{tC}O_{2}}{\\text{GJ}}}*41,868$\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that we do not have data for emission\nfactors for sector-fuel types when the energy consumption is close to\nzero. Therefore, the following rules are applied to define emission\nfactors when missing:\n\n| Sector-Fuel types                       | Assumptions                                        |\n| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| Power sector-LPG                        | Equal to emission factors in the industrial sector |\n| Road-LPG                                | Equal to emission factors in the building sector   |\n| Power sector-Kerosene and Road-Kerosene | Equal to emission factors in the building sector   |\n| Road-Coal                               | Equal to emission factors in the power sector      |\n| Road-Other oil products                 | Equal to emission factors for diesel               |\n| All sectors-Biomass                     | Emission factors are equal to zero                 |\n\n### Energy-related emissions\n\nEnergy-related emissions are estimated across sectors and by aggregating\nsectors (i.e., Transport, Power, Industry, Building, and Other energy\nuses) for the four GHGs (i.e. $\\text{CO}_{2}$, $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$\nand F-gases). In this section, the index $u = E$, denotes the\nenergy-related sectors.\n\n#### Carbon dioxide ($CO_{2}$) and methane ($CH_{4}$)\n\nEnergy-related $CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ emissions are calculated by\nmultiplying energy consumption by emissions factors. Emissions are\nmultiplied by $10^{- 6}$ as the emission factor $\\text{ef}$ is given\nin tCO2e/ktoe and the fossil fuel consumption $F$ is given in ktoe, to\nobtain emissions in mtCO2e. We neglect this unit transformation in the\ndescription below.\n\nIn 2019, these emissions (both $CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ energy-related\nemissions) are scaled to UNFCCC inventory emissions, meaning they are\nmultiplied by a factor such that base-year emissions are equal in the\nmodel and the inventory. In other words, the model is adjusting $_{}$\nand $_{}$ emissions to match the model and inventory. This scaling\nfactor is close to 1 for $CO_{2}$, but are typically greater than one\nfor $CH_{4}$. This scaling applies only to the aggregate emissions and\nnot to the price effect. It only applies to the core modelled emissions\nof energy related $CO_{2}$, and $CH_{4}$ and not to any other gas or\nany other UNFCCC sector.\n\nAfter 2019, these emissions are thus calculated, for each fuel $f$ and\nfor a year $t$, as the multiplication of the fossil fuel’s consumption\nfor year $t$ by the sector’s associated to emission factor:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocEsfpt}} = F_{\\text{ocEsft}}*ef_{\\text{cEsfp}}$\n\nwhere $o$ represents scenario, $s$, sector, $f$, fuel type, $p$,\nGHG (e.g., $CO_{2}$) and $t$ the year.\n\n$CO_{2}$ and $CH_{4}$ emissions are determined across all fuels and\nacross all sectors (and grouping sectors). Total energy emissions are\ndetermined as the sum across sectors and fuels (for energy related\nemissions u=E)\n\n$em_{\\text{ocpt}} = \\sum_{s}^{}{\\sum_{f}^{}e}m_{\\text{ocsfpt}}$\n\nFurthermore, total energy-related $_{}$ **and** $_{}$ emissions are\naugmented by energy distribution losses and methane energy-related\nemissions are subject to a calibration. In particular:\n\n  - **Total energy-related** $\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{O}_{\\mathbf{2}}$\n    **emissions** include energy distribution losses, that is the sum of\n    combustion emissions and the fugitive and venting $CO_{2}$\n    emissions. The latter are mostly from natural gas pipes plus coal\n    mines. These are a part of energy-related $CO_{2}$ emissions but\n    they are not combustion.\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n  - **Total energy-related** $\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{4}}$\n    **emissions** are calibrated to 2019 shares. The factor is the 2019\n    ratio of methane emissions to the sum of the total global warming\n    potential[^3_46] from methane emissions $\\text{gwp}$ and the\n    methane fugitive and venting emissions $\\text{fug}$. Then,\n    projections are made by multiplying this factor with the sum of the\n    $\\text{gwp}$ and the $\\text{fug}$ for the current year $t$.\n    For $t \\geq 2019$:\n\n$em_{ocE,CH_{4},t} = \\frac{em_{ocE,CH_{4},2019}}{\\text{gw}p_{ocE,CH_{4},2019} + \\text{fu}g_{ocE,CH_{4},2019}}*\\left( \\text{gw}p_{ocE,CH_{4},t} + \\text{fu}g_{ocE,CH_{4},t} \\right)$\n\nCPAT also covers the other parts of the UNFCCC inventories (i.e. GHGs\nother than $CO_{2}$ and methane, and other categories than\nenergy-related GHGs). For these emissions, the UNFCCC inventories are\nscaled by various growth rates, detailed in the next section.\n\n#### Nitrous oxide ($N_{2}O$) and Flourinated gases (F-gases)\n\n$N_{2}O$ *and F-gases energy-related emissions estimates follow the\nbelow rules:*\n\n  - **Total energy-related** $\\mathbf{N}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{O}$\n    **emissions** are scaled to $CO_{2}$ emissions. For $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{oc,N_{2}O,t} = em_{oc,N_{2}O,\\left( t - 1 \\right)}*\\frac{em_{\\text{oc},CO_{2},t}}{em_{\\text{oc},CO_{2},\\left( t - 1 \\right)}}$\n\n  - **Total energy-related F-gases emissions** ($p = \\text{PF}C_{s}$,\n    $\\text{HF}C_{s}$, $SF6$, $NF3$) are historically zero for the\n    energy category. For $t > 2018$: $em_{\\text{ocpt}} = 0$.\n\n### Non-energy related emissions\n\nNon-energy-related emissions are estimated across non-energy-related\nsectors (i.e. Agriculture, Industrial Process, LULUCF, Waste, and Other)\nfor the four GHGs (i.e. $\\text{CO}_{2}$, $CH_{4}$, $N_{2}O$ and\nF-gases). Non-energy-related emissions in the different sectors\nconsidered above are determined based on various sector-specific\nassumptions. In particular:\n\n  - In the **industrial processes and product use** sector, the growth\n    rate is based on changes in energy-related industrial $CO_{2}$\n    emissions.\n\n  - Non-energy **agriculture** emissions are forecasted based on the GDP\n    and population growths.\n\n  - Forecasted non-energy emissions for **LULUCF** are driven by a sink\n    activity growth and the ratio of the growth in emissions for the\n    carbon tax scenario to the increase in emissions for the baseline\n    scenario. Net sources and net sinks are treated differently (see\n    below)\n\n  - For **waste and other** emissions, forecasted estimates are\n    determined by population growth.\n\n#### Industrial processes and product use\n\nIn the industrial processes and product use sector, the growth rate is\nbased on changes in energy-related industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions.\n\nIn what follows, the index $u = I$, standing for Industrial Processes\nand Product Use.\n\nNon-energy-related industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions are forecasted based\non an industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions rate\n($\\text{Δe}m_{ocP,CO_{2},t + 1}$). Therefore:\n\n$\\text{Δe}m_{ocI,CO_{2},t + 1} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\max\\left( 0;\\frac{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t + 1}}{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t}} - 1 \\right) & \\text{for\\ }t = 2019 \\\\\n\\frac{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t + 1}}{em_{\\text{ocEind},CO_{2},t}} - 1 & \\text{for\\ }t > 2019 \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $\n\nThe index $\\text{Eind}$ stands for the energy-related emissions in the\nindustrial sector.\n\nImportantly, it is assumed that other pollutants $p$ are scaled on the\nsame industrial $CO_{2}$ emissions rate. In other words, emissions of\neach pollutant for a year $t$ is the sum of emissions from the\nprevious year $t - 1$ adjusted by the change in industrial $CO_{2}$\nemissions $\\text{Δem}$.\n\nFor $t > 2019$:\n$em_{\\text{ocIpt}} = em_{\\text{ocIp}\\left( t - 1 \\right)}*\\left( 1 + \\text{Δe}m_{\\text{ocI},CO_{2},t} \\right)$\n\n#### Agriculture\n\nNon-energy agriculture emissions are forecasted based on the GDP and\npopulation growths (and a proxy for additional mitigation efforts – if\nselected by the user).\n\nFor this section, $u = A$.\n\nAgricultural emissions are projected using a similar approach to the\nrest of CPAT: a reduced-form approach with elasticities, notably per\ncapita income $\\epsilon_{Y}$ (GDP growth: $Y_{\\text{grow}}$) and\npopulation $\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}$ specific to each UNFCCC emissions\nsector (population growth: $lp_{\\text{grow}}$).\n\nIn addition, the user has the option to assume that non-$CO_{2}$ GHGs\nscale with fossil $CO_{2}$, which is a proxy for additional\n(e.g., non-pricing) mitigation effort $(ame$) in the UNFCCC\ncategories. **This option, in effect, turns a carbon price into an\nall-sector (incl non-energy sectors) GHG tax (incl. methane, N20 etc).**\n\nFor each pollutant and for $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocApt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocAp},t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{A,t - 1}}(1 + Y_{\\text{growth}})^{\\epsilon_{Y}}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}}*\\text{am}e_{\\text{At}}$\n\n#### Land use, land-use change and forestry\n\nLULUCF GHG are assumed to be flat in the baseline and policy scenario\nfor net sink countries (where sinks of GHGs exceed sources). For\ncountries where LULUCF is a source, we assume an exogenous decline of\n2.5% per annum in both the baseline and policy scenario. The user should\nnote that this rate can be adjusted in the dashboard.\n\n![](./03/media/image38.png)\n\nFigure 3‑29: LULUCF emissions decline rate\n\nAt the global level, this aligns with approximately the midpoint of\nIAMs’ projection for LULUCF. Where the country assumes ‘additional\nmitigation effort in non-energy sectors’ LULUCF GHGs decline at the rate\nof energy $_{}$.\n\nFor this section, $u = L$.\n\nIt is considered that a defined amount of emissions can be subtracted\nyearly, based on the 2019 level. Therefore, we introduce the LULUCF\nemissions decline $\\text{Δe}m_{L,t}$ (in annual %, in absolute value\nof the start year).\n\n  - For $p = CO_{2}$:\n\nIn the case of $CO_{2}$, we create a condition to model the sink\nactivity of LULUCF ($em_{\\text{ocLpt}} < 0$ or $> 0$). In both\ncases, we subtract an annual capture of $CO_{2}$ based on the LULUCF\nemissions decline $\\text{Δe}m_{\\text{Lt}}$. If the emissions of the\nprevious year $t - 1$ are positive, we scale the emissions with the\nratio $\\frac{a\\text{me}_{cLp,t}}{\\text{ame}_{\\text{cLp},t - 1}}$ with\n$a\\text{me}_{cLp,t} = \\ \\frac{em_{P,cLt}}{em_{B,cLt}}$, which\nrepresents the ratio between energy-related emissions under a policy and\nbaseline scenario.\n\nFor $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\nem_{ocLp,t - 1} - \\left| em_{\\text{ocLp},2019}*\\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \\right| & \\text{if\\ }em_{ocLp,t - 1} < 0 \\\\\n\\frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{a\\text{me}_{\\text{cLp},t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{\\text{cLpt}} - \\left| em_{\\text{ocL},2019}*\\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \\right| & \\text{if\\ }em_{ocLp,t - 1} \\geq 0 \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $\n\n  - For $p = CH_{4}$:\n\nThe same logic as for $CO_{2}$ is used, without considering the\ncondition for sinks.\n\nFor $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocLp}\\left( t - 1 \\right)}}{\\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,Lt} - \\left| em_{\\text{ocLp},2019}*\\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \\right|$\n\n  - For $p = N_{2}O$:\n\nIn the case of $N_{2}O$, we assume the level of emissions to grow\naccordingly to the population growth $lp_{\\text{grow}}$.\n\nFor $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\frac{em_{ocLp,t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{B,L,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow}} \\right) - \\left| em_{\\text{ocLp},2019}*\\text{Δe}m_{L,t} \\right|$\n\n  - For F-gases ($p = \\text{PF}C_{s}$, $\\text{HF}C_{s}$, $SF6$,\n    $NF3$):\n\nIn the case of F-gases, we assume the level of emissions to grow\naccordingly to the population growth $lp_{\\text{grow}}$. However, it\nis the only case where we do not consider the LULUCF emissions decline.\n\nFor $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocLpt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocLp},t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{B,Lp,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,Lt}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow}} \\right)$\n\n##### Waste and Others\n\nFor waste and other emissions, forecasted estimates are determined by\npopulation growth.\n\nFor this section, we consider that $u = W$ and $O$, denoting\nrespectively Waste and Others type of emissions.\n\nWaste emissions are projected using a similar approach to Agricultural\nemissions: a reduced-form approach with population growth elasticity\n$\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}$ (population growth: $lp_{\\text{grow}}$). We\ninclude again the additional (e.g. non-pricing) mitigation effort\n$\\text{ame}$.\n\nFor each pollutant and for $t > 2019$:\n\n$em_{\\text{ocupt}} = \\frac{em_{\\text{ocup},t - 1}}{\\text{am}e_{B,u,t - 1}}*\\text{am}e_{P,ut}*\\left( 1 + lp_{\\text{grow},t} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\text{lp}}}$\n\n### National Determined Contributions\n\nCPAT harmonizes National Determined Contributions (NDCs) for 192\ncountries to show target GHG emissions levels (excluding LULUCF) in\n2030, based on several major NDC characteristics, that is conditionality\nand sectoral coverage. This section presents the different types of\nNDCs. Country cases illustrating how NDCs are calculated in CPAT are\npresented in Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations.\n\n#### Types of NDCs\n\nThere are different types of NDCs:\n\n  - **Business as usual (BAU) targets**: NDC target is a percent\n    reduction from the country’s BAU scenario. For example, Albania’s\n    NDC is 11.5% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the baseline\n    scenario in 2030.\n  - **Fixed targets**: NDC target is a fixed level of GHG/CO2 emissions\n    in target (future) year. For example, Argentina’s NDC is a cap of\n    359 MtCO2e net emissions in 2030.\n  - **Historical targets**: NDC target is a percent or fixed reduction\n    from the level of emissions in past years. For example, Australia’s\n    NDC is 26 to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030.\n  - **Intensity targets**: NDC target is a reduction in emissions\n    intensity. For example, Uruguay’s NDC is emissions intensity\n    reduction (GHG/GDP) of 24% in CO2 from 1990 levels.\n  - **Unquantifiable targets**: NDCs with no specific emissions\n    reduction commitments. For example, Saudi Arabia’s NDC: “The Kingdom\n    will engage in actions and plans in pursuit of economic\n    diversification that have co-benefits in the form of greenhouse gas\n    (GHG) emission avoidances and adaptation to the impacts of climate\n    change, as well as reducing the impacts of response measures.”\n\nNDCs could also present conditional and unconditional targets:\n\n  - **Unconditional targets**: Countries would use their own resources\n    and technologies to achieve unconditional goals.\n  - **Conditional targets**: Countries would need international support\n    to achieve these (more ambitious) goals.\n\n#### Harmonization of NDCs: Country cases\n\nCPAT excludes LULUCF emissions from NDC calculations, so in case LULUCF\nemissions were included in initial document, the goals are recalculated\nwith LULUCF, using the latest available data for LULUCF GHG emissions\nand user-identified growth parameters for these emissions. If not\nstated, we assume that the NDC target includes LULUCF.\n\nBy default, CPAT models the impact of carbon pricing on energy-related\nemissions. Hence, for countries with high levels of emissions from\nnon-energy related sources (agriculture, waste, LULUCF), the\ncalculations would imply a high burden on energy sector to achieve NDC\ngoals. For more information, see Appendix D - Examples of NDCs\ncalculations, which presents examples of NDCs calculations.\n\n## Fiscal revenues\n\nThe fiscal revenues section in the mitigation tab of CPAT is organized\nas follows:\n\n  - Additional information, including **total fuel expenditure** broken\n    down per fuel and sector grouping and **revenues/losses from price\n    controls** broken down per fuel. These data are not used in the\n    calculation of fiscal revenues.\n  - **Policy coverage** showing the percentage coverage of CO2 emissions\n    under the policy selected and for each sector group and fuel.\n  - **The different components of the fiscal revenues** detailed in the\n    subsequent section.\n\n### Overview\n\nRevenues from mitigation policies are estimated by comparing any\nrevenues from the policy and fuel taxes, net of any outlays from fuel\nsubsidies, in the baseline scenario with those in the policy scenario.\nFiscal revenues in CPAT are calculated for several types of taxes, by\nfuel and sector. Revenue-raising policies include carbon taxes, ETSs\nwith auctioned allowances, increases in fuel/electricity excises, and\nreductions in fossil fuel subsidies. Revenue-reducing policies include\nexpenditures (e.g., on renewable subsidies) and regulations (which\nreduce the base of pre-existing fuel taxes).\n\nCPAT differentiates two types of revenues:\n\n  - **Carbon tax revenues**, which are the result of the carbon tax\n    multiplied by emissions factor and energy use.\n  - **Full revenues**, which include other taxes, VAT changes, excise\n    duties, existing ETS schemes, etc. The changing revenues according\n    to a carbon tax are not just simple revenues but also any changes\n    associated with full revenues. For instance, there could be changes\n    in subsidies due to changes in energy consumed.\n\nA general formula for fiscal revenues calculations is:\n\n$\\text{re}v_{\\text{ocfgt}} = F_{\\text{ocfgt}}*\\varphi_{\\text{cgft}}*\\text{nc}p_{\\text{ocfgt}}$\n\nwhere $\\text{re}v_{\\text{cfgt}}$ is the fiscal revenues from fuel\n$f$ in sector $g$, $F_{\\text{cfgt}}$ is the energy consumption,\n$\\varphi_{\\text{cgft}}$ is the sector-fuel coverage and\n$\\text{nc}p_{\\text{cfgt}}$ denotes the tax (policy) rate per unit of\nenergy consumption.\n\nIn the dashboard, the graph below shows total additional (vs. baseline)\nfiscal revenues from the policy net of renewable energy subsidies. Note\nthat this includes base effects on existing taxes and subsidies, so even\na revenue-neutral policy that nevertheless changes the base of existing\ntaxes will have some effects on these, net, revenues.\n\n![Figure 64: Dashboard: Fiscal revenues raised by fuel and total as % of\nGDP](./03/media/image39.png)\n\nFigure 3‑30: Dashboard: Fiscal revenues raised by fuel and total as % of\nGDP\n\nThe user can also see total revenues (i.e. not against the baseline\nscenario) according to the different fuels net of subsidies.\n\n![Figure 65: Dashboard: Total revenues by fuel source net of\nsubsidies](./03/media/image40.png)\n\n*Figure* *3‑31: Dashboard: Total revenues by fuel source net of\nsubsidies*\n\nThe remaining of the section presents the calculations of revenues and\nits breakdown in more details.\n\n### Notation\n\n| **Notation**      | **Variable**                                   | **Unit**                                                                        |\n| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| $\\text{rev}$    | Fiscal revenues                                | Real 2021 US$bn                                                                 |\n| $F $              | Energy consumption                             | ktoe                                                                            |\n| $\\varphi$       | Sector-fuel coverage                           | %                                                                               |\n| $\\text{ncp}$    | New Carbon Price                               | US$/ton of CO2                                                                  |\n| $\\text{revExi}$ | Revenues from existing excises and other taxes | Real 2021 US$bn                                                                 |\n| $\\text{cs}$     | Consumer-side subsidy                          | US$/Gj                                                                          |\n| $\\text{fao}$    | Fixed/ad val part/other                        | US$/Gj                                                                          |\n| $\\text{xct}$    | Current carbon tax                             | US$/Gj                                                                          |\n| $\\text{xetsp}$  | Current ETS permit price                       | US$/Gj                                                                          |\n| $\\text{revVAT}$ | Revenues from VAT                              | Real 2021 US$bn                                                                 |\n| $\\text{vat}$    | Value added tax                                | US$/Gj                                                                          |\n| $\\text{cstPs}$  | Losses from producer-side subsidies            | Real 2021 US$bn                                                                 |\n| $\\text{subDem}$ | Subsidized demand                              | Billion liters for oil, GJ for coal and natural gas and GWh for electricity     |\n| $\\text{pusF}$   | Per-unit fossil fuels subsidies                | US$/liters for oil, US$/GJ for coal and natural gas and US$/GWh for electricity |\n| $\\text{cstRen}$ | Cost of renewable subsidies                    | Real 2021 US$bn                                                                 |\n| $\\text{pusRen}$ | Per-unit renewable subsidies                   | US$/kwh                                                                         |\n\n### Total revenues raised by policy\n\nFiscal revenues are calculated according to the selected power model\n(Elasticity, Engineer or Average) and are expressed in billions of\ndollars (in real terms based on the year 2021) and % of GDP. Please note\nthat revenues can be broken down per fuel. Total revenues are composed\nof:\n\n  - **Revenues from the baseline scenario** raised for each fuel and\n    sector coverage. The estimation of these revenues follows the\n    general formula for fiscal revenues presented above (i.e. the carbon\n    tax multiplied by emissions factor and energy use).\n  - **Revenues from existing excises and other taxes, including\n    consumer-side subsidies**. This describes all existing taxes and\n    consumer side subsidies. Excise and other taxes are composed of:\n      - Consumer-side subsidy: $cs_{\\text{ft}}$;\n      - Fixed/ad val part/other: $\\text{fa}o_{\\text{ft}}$;\n      - Current carbon tax: $\\text{xc}t_{\\text{ft}}$; and\n      - Current ETS permit price: $\\text{xets}p_{\\text{ft}}$.\n\nFor each fuel, we multiply the fuel consumption (minus the other energy\nuse part, which is assumed not to be covered by excises) by the sum of\nall the current excises. If the existing ETS is EU ETS, then the excise\nand other taxes from current ETS permit price are not taken into\naccount. It is worths noting that for coal and natural gas, the formula\nbelow is used across sectors as these fuels are broken down per data on\nexcise taxes in the sector groupings (i.e. industry, buildings and power\nsectors).\n\nRevenues from existing excises and other taxes,\n$\\text{revEx}i_{\\text{ft}}$, are thus estimated as follows:\n\n$\\text{revEx}i_{\\text{ft}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\left( F_{\\text{ocft}} - F_{\\text{oc},\\text{oen},\\text{ft}} \\right)*\\left( cs_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{fa}o_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{xc}t_{\\text{cft}} \\right) & \\text{if\\ }\\text{ExistingETS} = \\text{EUETS} \\\\\n\\left( F_{\\text{ocft}} - F_{\\text{oc},\\text{oen},\\text{ft}} \\right)*\\left( cs_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{fa}o_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{xc}t_{\\text{cft}} + \\text{xets}p_{\\text{cft}} \\right) & \\text{if\\ }\\text{ExistingETS} \\neq \\text{EUETS} \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $\n\nwhere $F_{\\text{ft}}$ denotes energy consumption and\n$F_{\\text{oen},\\text{ft}}$ energy consumption in the Other Energy Use\nsector grouping.\n\nFor electricity, revenues from additional excise tax are also estimated\nbased on the power prices determined in the engineer power model. The\nadditional excise tax is multiplied by the energy use and the\nconsumer-side tax/subsidy in the residential sector and the tax/subsidy\non industrial users in the non-residential sector.\n\n  - **Revenues from additional excise tax** (if it exists – additional\n    excise tax can be inputted in the Manual Inputs tab.) raised for\n    each fuel and sector, calculating as the additional excise tax\n    multiplied by the energy use. For electricity, however, it is worth\n    noting that revenues from additional excise tax relies on the\n    engineer power model estimations.\n\n  - **Revenues from VAT**. Following the same logic as for existing\n    excises and other taxes and additional excise taxes, revenues from\n    VAT are calculated across sector grouping as the multiplication of\n    the fuel consumption (minus the other energy use part\n    $F_{\\text{oen},f,t}$, which is assumed not to be covered by the\n    VAT) by the associated VAT payment rate $\\text{va}t_{\\text{cft}}$:\n\n$\\text{revVA}T_{\\text{ft}} = \\left( F_{\\text{ocft}} - F_{\\text{oc},\\text{oen},\\text{ft}} \\right)*\\text{va}t_{\\text{cft}}$\n\nFor electricity, revenues from VAT are obtained by multiplying the\nenergy use by the VAT payment in the residential non-residential\nsectors.\n\n  - **Losses from producer-side subsidies**. Producer-side subsidies\n    represent a loss and are thus subtracted from total fiscal revenues.\n    They do not affect the calculation of prices in CPAT and thus\n    revenues unless they are phased out, if they exist. Note that\n    implicitly the underlined that we are using has already been\n    adjusted for producer-side subsidies, in particular in the case of\n    coal. Producer-side subsidies, $\\text{cstP}s_{\\text{ocft}}$, are\n    defined as the product between the per-unit subsidies[^3_47],\n    $\\text{pus}F_{\\text{ocft}}$, and the subsidized demand,\n    $\\text{subDe}m_{\\text{ocft}}$:\n\n$\\text{cstP}s_{\\text{ocft}} = \\text{subDe}m_{\\text{ocft}}*\\text{pus}F_{\\text{ocft}}$\n\nwhere:\n\n  - Subsidized demand is determined based on both global demand data\n    from the IEA and domestic demand data directly estimated in CPAT.\n    The estimation of subsidized demand differs depending on the fuel\n    considered. For oil, subsidized demand is equal to global demand as\n    it is a global traded product. Subsidized demand for coal and\n    natural gas represent 50% of global demand and 50% of domestic\n    demand. Finally for electricity, only domestic demand is used and\n    depends on the power model selected. Subsidized demand can also vary\n    according to the global energy demand scenario selected in the\n    dashboard.\n\n![Figure 66: Dashboard: Global energy demand\nscenario](./03/media/image41.png)\n\nFigure 3‑32: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario\n\n  - Per unit subsidies are taken from the Prices section of CPAT. For\n    coal, gasoline and natural gas, per unit subsidies correspond to the\n    average across all sectors. Importantly, per unit subsidies are\n    equal across sector grouping. For electricity, producer-side\n    subsidies are retrieved from the non-residential sector\n    (i.e. denoted as industrial sector) of the Power Prices section of\n    CPAT, determined in the engineer power model.\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n  - **Cost of renewable subsidies** (if applicable – renewable subsidies\n    are defined by the user in the dashboard). If specified by the user,\n    $\\text{cstRe}n_{\\text{ocft}}$ represents the cost of implementing\n    renewable electricity subsidy (or tax). In addition, the user can\n    also add renewable subsidies under the baseline scenario. This cost\n    is thus equal to the product between\n    $\\text{pusRe}n_{\\text{ocft}}$, the cost of renewable subsidies in\n    $/kWh (in real terms) and, $g_{\\text{ocft}}$, the electricity\n    supplied in the power sector according to the power model chosen.\n\n$\\text{cstRe}n_{\\text{ocft}} = \\text{pusRe}n_{\\text{ocft}}*g_{\\text{ocft}}$\n\nThese costs are estimated for each renewable energy, that is wind,\nsolar, hydropower and other renewables.\n\n### Additional information\n\nRevenue or losses from price controls and total fuel expenditures can\nalso be found in the Fiscal Revenues section of CPAT. These estimations\nare not used in the calculation of the total fiscal revenues.\n\n#### Revenues/losses from price controls\n\nRevenues/losses from price controls, $\\text{ct}r_{\\text{ocft}}$, are\ncalculated by multiplying fuel consumption across sectors (minus the\nother energy use part, on which price control does not apply) by the\ndifference in fuel’s international prices from the current year to the\nprevious one,\n$\\text{pIn}t_{\\text{ocft}} - \\text{pIn}t_{\\text{ocf},t - 1}$, and by\nthe portion of global energy price changes not passed-through into\ndomestic prices, $\\text{pt}h_{\\text{ocft}} - 1$.\n\n$\\text{ct}r_{\\text{ocft}} = \\left( F_{\\text{ocft}} - F_{\\text{oc},\\text{oen},\\text{ft}} \\right)*\\left( \\text{pt}h_{\\text{ocft}} - 1 \\right)*\\left( \\text{pIn}t_{\\text{ocft}} - \\text{pIn}t_{\\text{ocf},t - 1} \\right)$\n\n#### Total fuel expenditures\n\nTotal fuel expenditures are not part of the fiscal revenues, but show\nthe expenditures on fuel from a whole country perspective, as this is\noften relevant in developing countries wishing to minimize their import\nbill. Fuel expenditures are estimated for each fuel considered in CPAT\nand are expressed as the product between prices and energy consumption\nacross all sectors.\n\n## Monetized social costs and benefits\n\nIn this section, the theoretical framework is first presented in order\nto explain the approach used to assess efficiency costs and domestic\nenvironmental co-benefits. Then, this section describes how energy\nexternalities costs are estimated. Finally, these costs are used to\ncalculate monetized welfare benefits.\n\n### Overview\n\nFigure 3‑33 provides a representation of the fossil fuel market, where\nsupply and demand interact. Importantly, it is assumed that the energy\ndemand responds to prices in the private sector, although the\ninstitutional setup could, in some markets, play a role in preventing\nprices from determining supply and demand.\n\n![Figure 67: Efficiency costs and co-benefits in the presence of\nprior-tax and carbon charge](./03/media/image42.png)\n\nFigure 3‑33: Efficiency costs and co-benefits in the presence of\nprior-tax and carbon charge\n\nAt any point, the height of the demand curve reflects the benefit to\nconsumers from an extra unit of consumption, while the height of the\nsupply curve (drawn as flat here because constant returns to scale is\nassumed) reflects the cost to firms of producing an extra unit. If there\nis no pre-existing tax or subsidy in the market, the consumer and\nproducer price are equal, and the market equilibrium is efficient\n(leaving aside environmental impacts) because the benefit to consumers\nfrom the last unit consumed equals the cost to firms of supplying that\nunit.\n\n#### Efficiency costs without a prior tax\n\nIntroducing a carbon tax in a country is distortionary by nature from a\nlocal perspective (since it does not correct for a local externality per\nse), but with the aim of contributing to a global reduction in emissions\n(i.e., it contributes to reducing global externalities). Suppose a\ncarbon charge, equal to a carbon tax times the fuel’s CO2 emissions\nfactor, is now applied to the fuel. The charge drives a wedge between\nthe price paid by fuel users and the price received by fuel producers\nand reduces fuel use, resulting in an economic efficiency cost indicated\nby the shaded triangle *abg*. This efficiency cost is equal to the loss\nof benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, the integral under the\ndemand curve or trapezoid *adeg*, less savings in production costs to\nfirms, rectangle *bdeg*.\n\nAlternatively, the efficiency cost can be interpreted as the loss in\nconsumer and producer surplus (*jkga*) less revenue gains to the\ngovernment where the latter is rectangle *jkba*. Consumer surplus\nreflects the benefits of fuel use to consumers less the amount they pay\nfor the product (*jkga*) and is reduced from triangle *hkg* to triangle\n*hja* by the carbon charge. Producer surplus reflects revenue gains to\nfirms less production costs consumption but is zero with and without the\ncarbon charge as constant returns are assumed.\n\n#### Efficiency cost in the presence of a prior tax\n\nIt is now supposed that a prior tax on fuel use is applied. This prior\ntax drives a wedge between the consumer and producer price in the\ninitial equilibrium as indicated in Figure 3‑33. The efficiency cost of\nthe carbon charge is now given by trapezoid *acfg*. Again, this reflects\nlosses in benefits to consumers from the fuel reduction, trapezoid\n*adeg*, less savings in production costs, rectangle *cdef*.\nAlternatively, it is the loss in consumer surplus, trapezoid *jlma*,\nless revenue gains to the government, rectangle *jlca*.\n\nIn this case the efficiency cost has two components: (i) one-half times\nthe carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the overall CO2 reduction; and\n(ii) the pre-existing tax per unit of fuel use, times the fuel\nreduction, and aggregated across fuel markets.\n\n#### Efficiency costs in CPAT\n\nThe efficiency cost can be (approximately) computed by the ‘Harberger\ntriangle’, that is, one-half times the carbon charge expressed per unit\nof fuel use times the fuel reduction. If the carbon charge is applied to\nmultiple fuel products, the efficiency cost is the sum of Harberger\ntriangles across the fuel markets. Equivalently, the efficiency cost is\nsimply one-half times the carbon charge (per ton of CO2) times the\noverall CO2 reduction, which corresponds to the integral under the\nmarginal abatement cost (MAC) schedule where the latter is the\nhorizontal summation of individual MAC curves for all the behavioral\nresponses promoted by the carbon charge.\n\nIn CPAT, the efficiency costs follow the Harberger methodology, i.e.,\nefficiency costs are treated as deadweight costs, $\\text{ddw}$. These\ncosts correspond to the area of the trapezoid described above, which is\nexpressed as follows:\n\n$\\text{dd}w_{\\text{ft}} = \\frac{\\left( \\text{nc}p_{\\text{ft}} - xcp_{\\text{ft}} \\right)}{2}*(F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft})$\n\nWhere the first term\n$\\frac{\\left( \\text{nc}p_{\\text{ft}} - xcp_{\\text{ft}} \\right)}{2}$\nrepresents the average of new and pre-existing tax, respectively denoted\n$\\text{nc}p_{\\text{ft}}$ and $\\text{xc}p_{\\text{ft}}$, and\n$F_{P,ft} - F_{B,ft}$ corresponds to the change in fuel consumption\nfrom the baseline to the policy scenario.\n\n#### Co-benefits\n\nIf it is now supposed that there are also local air pollution or other\ndomestic environmental costs associated with use of the fuel product as\nindicated in Figure 3‑33. The reduction in fuel use from the carbon\ncharge reduces these costs by rectangle *ncfo*, which corresponds to the\ndomestic environmental co-benefits. In short, the area *acfg* is\npresumably due to the externality created from fossil fuel use in the\nfirst place – and hence that is why the entire *ncfo* area could be a\nbenefit. The net economic benefit is defined as the domestic\nenvironmental co-benefits—excluding global climate benefits—less\nefficiency costs. This is shown by trapezoid *noga*, as the co-benefits\nexceed the efficiency cost. More generally co-benefits might offset a\nportion of (rather than more than offsetting) efficiency costs in which\ncase net economic benefits are negative.\n\n### Energy externalities costs\n\nExternalities are deadweight losses from the tax before revenue\nrecycling and do not include revenue recycling and tax interaction\neffects. In the dashboard of CPAT, energy externality costs are\ncalculated under the baseline scenario and include costs above the\nmarginal cost, that is costs related to air pollution, congestion, road\ndamage and accidents and global warming. The sum of these externalities,\nincluding the supply costs and the potential VAT, actually defines what\nis called the ‘efficient price’.\n\n![](./03/media/image43.png)\n\nFigure 3‑34: Dashboard: Global energy demand scenario\n\nThese costs are displayed by fuel (i.e. coal, natural gas, electricity\nand liquid fuel, gasoline, diesel, LPG and kerosene) and sectors\ngrouping (except for liquid fuels) and broken down by various\ncomponents:\n\n1.  **Supply costs** as defined in the Prices section of CPAT.\n\n2.  **Air pollution costs**. These costs are associated mortality and\n    morbidity attributed to air pollution. Averted mortality is valued\n    using a Value of the Statistical Life (with the method selected by\n    the user) and morbidity, measured as years lived with disabilities,\n    is valued using a fraction of wages. See Section 6.7 of the Air\n    Pollution module for methodological details.\n\n3.  **Road accident costs** and **Congestion costs**[^3_48]. The main\n    road transport co-benefits of a carbon tax are a reduction in road\n    accidents (from a reduction in driving, changes in the vehicle\n    fleet, less aggressive driving, etc.) and a reduction in congestion\n    (from a reduction in driving, an increase in car sharing, changes in\n    the vehicle fleet, changes in transport timing decisions, etc.).\n    Externality costs are estimated based on the baseline and policy\n    forecast (i.e. adjusted for the fuel price change using a\n    country-specific elasticity) accidents/congestion. The monetary\n    value of accidents (multiplying fatalities by value of statistical\n    life) and congestion (multiplying time lost in traffic times value\n    of travel time) is then computed. Finally, the change in value of\n    accident/congestion is divided by the change in motor fuel\n    consumption.\n\n4.  **Global warming costs** are by default defined at the global level.\n    These costs are estimated based on the damage per ton CO2 (in real\n    USD$ 2021) and the level of CO2 emissions under both scenarios. Note\n    that several social cost of carbon can be selected:\n    \n      - The damage per ton of CO2 is by default set to a **social cost\n        of carbon**, fixed to 75USD$ in 2030, implying an annual rise in\n        real terms from 2018 of the social cost of carbon of 4%.\n    \n      - **Estimated social costs by Ricke et al. (2018)** for which the\n        national social cost of carbon discount rate and elasticity of\n        marginal utility can be modified. Note that Ricke et al. (2018)\n        estimates are country specific. More information can be found in\n        the tab “SCC” of CPAT.\n    \n      - The social cost of carbon can also rely on the **Global US EPA\n        estimates** with a 2.5% discount rate.\n    \n      - Finally, the user can manually enter a social cost of carbon (in\n        US$2021 per ton of CO2), assuming that the latter starts in year\n        2021.\n\nThese options can be modified in the dashboard:\n\n![Figure 69: Dashboard: Social cost of carbon (SCC)\nassumptions](./03/media/image44.png)\n\nFigure 3‑35: Dashboard: Social cost of carbon (SCC) assumptions\n\n  - **Potential VAT** can be calculated on the supply cost only or on\n    the supply cost augmented by all externalities (the default).\n\n### Monetized welfare benefits\n\nCPAT provides an assessment of climate co-benefits associated with\ncarbon pricing and fossil fuel price reform. Welfare benefits induced\nafter the introduction of the carbon tax include the monetized following\nitems (in real USD$ 2021), which are estimated based on the description\nof the costs described in the above section:\n\n1.  **Averted climate damages (national)** is defined as the difference\n    between the total national global warming costs in the baseline and\n    the policy scenario.\n2.  **Averted air pollution mortality/morbidity** is taken from the Air\n    Pollution module. The air pollution welfare gains are calculated\n    from reduced mortality and morbidity attributed to improvements in\n    air pollution. Averted mortality is valued using a Value of the\n    Statistical Life (with the method selected by the user) and\n    morbidity is valued as a fraction of wages. See Section 6.7 of the\n    Air Pollution module for methodological details.\n3.  **Averted road accidents** are taken from the transport module and\n    represent the change in the number of road accidents induced by the\n    implementation of the policy selected by the user, which thus\n    corresponds to externality benefits.\n4.  **Reduced congestion** is taken from the transport module. In the\n    same vein, external benefits from reduced congestion results from\n    the change in traffic induced by the implementation of the policy\n    selected by the user.\n5.  **Efficiency costs** are defined as the deadweight costs resulting\n    from the carbon tax (i.e. the average of existing and new carbon tax\n    introduced) and the change in fuel consumption for each fuel\n    considered, including electricity.\n\nCPAT dashboard shows monetized net welfare benefits as percentage of\nGDP.\n\n![Figure 70: Dashboard: Total monetized welfare](./03/media/image45.png)\n\nFigure 3‑36: Dashboard: Total monetized welfare\n\n## Validation\n\n### Overview\n\n**It is important to note that the validation exercise differs from the\ncalibration**. While the calibration performed for some variables\nthroughout the mitigation module prevents the model from deviating from\nobserved data (i.e. for 2019 to 2021), particularly in the context of\nCovid, the validation analysis covers a broader time horizon and aims to\nexplore how the mitigation module performs against other models or to\ncompare it against the literature. The analysis also includes\nsense-checking and parameter sensitivity analysis of the parameters\ndefined in the mitigation module. The validation is organized as\nfollows:\n\n1.  **Elasticities estimations**. As CPAT is mainly driven by\n    elasticities with respect to prices and economic activity, an\n    econometric analysis is carried out to compare the elasticities used\n    in CPAT and those obtained from an empirical analysis.\n\n2.  **Comparison of CPAT against other models**.\n\n3.  **Ex-post studies**. This section presents the literature's\n    estimates of the effectiveness of carbon pricing with respect to\n    emissions and compares them to the CPAT results.\n\n4.  **Hindcasting**. The hindcasting exercise aims at testing CPAT's\n    forecasts against observed data. It searches to evaluate the\n    performance of the used assumptions when trying to reproduce\n    historical information.\n\n5.  **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**. The analysis explores the\n    sensitivity of a set of selected parameters.\n\nBefore deep diving into the validation analysis, a first step in the\nvalidation process is performed to ensure that CPAT produces reliable\ndata, especially for the data fed into the rest of the validation\nanalysis. To further validate CPAT and check its functionality for all\ncountries the T and Tt scenarios have been created in the Multiscenario\nTool to test 826 parameters used in CPAT. The T-scenarios use average\npower models and show how CPAT behaves under different carbon taxation\nand how these parameters change. There are six testing scenarios:\n\n1.  **T0-T6**, when T0 has no carbon tax;\n2.  **T1** (small carbon tax scenario) introduces 12$ carbon tax with\n    20$ target carbon tax;\n3.  **T3** (medium carbon tax scenario) introduces 36$ carbon tax with\n    60$ target carbon tax;\n4.  **T6** (high carbon tax) introduces 120$ carbon tax with 200$ target\n    carbon tax; and\n5.  **The T2, T4 and T5** introduce intermediate rates for comparison.\n\nIn addition to these scenarios, the scenarios denoted Tt (i.e. T0t-T6t)\nuse engineer model instead of Average power models and hold the same\nassumptions and carbon tax rates as the T scenarios described above\n(i.e. T0-T6). In order to test CPAT, the following steps were performed:\n\n1.  **Settings**. The T0-T6 use average model, while T0t – T6t scenarios\n    use engineer model.\n\n2.  **Model runs**. The MT is run using the same defaults.\n\n3.  **Data**. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on\n    826 parameters for 218 countries.\n\n**The scenarios aim to provide data for further Parameter Sensitivity,\nhindcasting and comparison analysis, as well as signal any problems with\ncountry specific results**, i.e. due to the poor data quality. Based on\nthe outcomes, we classify countries into working and ones which produce\nspurious results. The Table on Countries coverage presented in the User\nGuide results from this testing.\n\n### Panel estimation of energy demand\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThis section describes the results from the estimation of some of the\nfuel demand equations incorporated in CPAT. The aim is to\n\n  - Deliver an empirical view of the elasticities with respect to price\n    and economic activity;\n  - Establish the size and direction of any linear trend in fuel\n    consumption; and\n  - Reflect on the difference between the value of the elasticities and\n    trends estimated in this study and those currently used in CPAT.\n\nElasticities describe the percentage change in a dependent variable in\nresponse to a percentage change in an independent (driving) variable. As\nan example, a price elasticity equal to -0.3 implies that a 100%\nincrease in the price delivers a 30% reduction in fuel consumption. In\nthe case of models using data undergoing a logarithm transformation, the\nelasticity with respect to a given variable is simply the estimated\ncoefficient on that variable.\n\n#### Methodology\n\nThe approach used here reflects underlying CPAT model and database\nstructure in relation to:\n\n  - **Frequency of data and timespan**. In the estimation we used annual\n    data ranging between 2000 and 2018, i.e. the dataset currently\n    incorporated in CPAT. This is a panel dataset in which information\n    for a set of fuels consumed in a set of sectors (and their driving\n    variables) is observed across time and countries (here taken as the\n    unit dimension of the panel).\n\n  - **Driving factors**. Consumption of a fuel in a specific sector is\n    assumed to be a function of fuel price (in that sector) and of the\n    overall level of economic activity (as measured by the GDP), with\n    both variables expressed in real terms.\n\n  - **Static functional form**. The whole impact of a change in a\n    driving variable, say, price, unfolds within the year covered by\n    that observation. This means that last year’s prices have no impact\n    on this year’s and future consumption.\n\n  - **Sectorial disaggregation**. Results are reported based on the\n    disaggregation underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT\n    (industrial, service, residential and transport) but data are\n    available for a number of industrial subsectors and transport modes\n    (as shown in Appendix B - Energy balances, Figure 3‑47) which are\n    used in the estimation. This implies that we are able to produce\n    estimates for the elasticities of a fuel consumed in any industrial\n    subsector, so that the range of these estimates for the industrial\n    sector as a whole is indicated as with a boxplot in Figure 3‑37 and\n    Figure 3‑38.\n\n  - **Fuel disaggregation**. Results are reported based on the fuels\n    underlying the current set of elasticities in CPAT (coal,\n    electricity, natural gas, other oil products, biomass, diesel and\n    gasoline). In the case of other oil products, we are able to rely on\n    two fuels in the estimation: kerosene and lpg.\n\nWe estimated the fuel demand below for each combination of sector and\nfuel for which estimation was deemed relevant and feasible:\n\n$\\begin{matrix}\n\\text{ln\\:f}c_{\\text{it}} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{1}\\text{\\:ln\\:}y_{\\text{it}} + \\beta_{2}\\text{\\:ln\\:}p_{\\text{it}} + \\beta_{3}\\text{\\:t} + \\epsilon_{\\text{it}} \\\\\n\\end{matrix},$\n\nwhere $fc_{\\text{it}}$ indicates the consumption of a specific fuel at\ntime *t* in country *i* in a specific sector, $p_{\\text{it}}$\nindicates the price for that fuel and $y_{\\text{it}}$ the overall\nlevel of GDP in the country. There are no indices in relation to the\nsector and the fuel in the equation as estimation is conducted for each\ncombination of fuels and sectors. The individual effects $\\alpha_{i}$\nreflect constant (across time) factors which affect fuel consumption in\na specific sector in a specific country given the value of the\nindependent variables in the model. An example for these factors could\nbe energy efficiency policies affecting fuel consumption regardless of\nthe level of economic activity and price. Finally, $t$ is a linear\ntime trend. We also introduced a time effect $\\lambda_{t}$ but it was\nnever found to be statistically significant when a linear trend was also\nincluded.\n\nIn terms of relevance, we excluded sectors for which the CPAT dataset\ncontained data covering less than 0.5 GTOE while in terms of feasibility\nwe required a minimum of about 300 observations for a sector-fuel\ncombination to be included in the analysis. As a consequence, the number\nof units (countyries) used in the analysis varied from more than 150 in\nthe case of gasoline used for road transport to 13 in the case of coal\nused for non-energy use or otherwise not included in other industrial\nsubsectors.\n\n##### Adopted estimators\n\nThe following estimators were implemented: 1) the between estimator\n(BE); 2) the pooled OLS estimator (POLS) and; 3) the Common Correlated\nEffects Mean Group (CMG) estimator of Pesaran (2006). The results from\nthe Between and Pooled OLS estimator are reported only for those cases\nwhen they produce consistent estimates, ie. when regressors are not\ncorrelated with individual effects as assessed by the Hausman test. The\nchoice of these estimators was motivated by the aim of assessing the\nlong-term impact of driving factors on fuel consumption - despite the\nuse of a static functional form in CPAT - and evidence of\nCross-Sectional Dependence (i.e. correlation across the units in a panel\ndataset).\n\nMore precisely, the choice of adopting these estimators is motivated by\nthe following considerations:\n\n  - The BE produces consistent estimates of long-run coefficients for a\n    panel with adequate number of observations across time and units (in\n    our case countries) as formally discussed in Pesaran and Smith\n    (1995). It also produced the best estimate of long-run price\n    coefficient for gasoline in the Monte Carlo simulation discussed in\n    Baltagi and Griffin (1984), although estimates from POLS were not\n    markedly different.\n\n  - The POLS produced the most robust forecasts (assessed based on the\n    RMSE) in the Monte Carlo study in Baltagi and Griffin (1984). In the\n    same study, the BE produced very similar results, although with\n    (slightly) higher errors.\n\n  - The CMG estimator produces unbiased estimates when cross-sectional\n    dependence (CSD), which was assessed based on the test in Pesaran\n    (2015), is correlated to included regressors in the model. We used\n    robust standard errors (Beck and Katz 1995; Driscoll and Kraay 1998)\n    to take into account cross-sectional dependence but this is a valid\n    approach only if the unobserved factors responsible for correlation\n    across units are not correlated to variables in the model, in our\n    case fuel price and GDP. Although the CMG estimator is robust to any\n    form of Cross-Sectional Dependence, the extent to which it captures\n    long-term impact of driving variables in a static model is not\n    clear.\n\nTwo versions of the equation above are implemented in the case of the\nPOLS and CMG estimators: one with a global linear trend, one with a\ntrend allowed to vary across countries. Considering the number of\nestimates we obtain we report only those which were statistically\nsignificant at the 10% level and conform to economic theory,\ne.g. positive elasticity on economic activity and negative on the fuel\nprice.\n\n##### Data\n\nData used in this study reflects the dataset underlying CPAT. This means\nusing:\n\n  - fuel consumption data from IEA energy balances;\n  - nominal GDP data from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) database\n    converted into real terms by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n    also from IMF’s WEO;\n  - nominal fuel prices data from IMF’s database, also converted into\n    real terms by using the CPI index.\n\nAll the variables were converted into logarithms before the estimation.\n\n#### Results\n\n##### Price elasticities\n\nFigure 3‑37 compares the estimates of price elasticities obtained here\nwith those used in CPAT for the transport (quadrant A), residential\n(quadrant B), industrial (C) and service sector (D). Estimated\nelasticities are similar to those used in CPAT in the case of the:\n\n  - residential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we\n    estimated -0.1 - considerably lower than the -0.4 value used in\n    CPAT;\n\n  - industrial sector, with the of exception of diesel for which CPAT\n    uses the high value of -1.1.\n\nDifference between the elasticity in CPAT (-0.61) and the value\nestimated here (-0.19) for gasoline in the transport sector might be\nrelated to the fact that only the estimate from the CMG estimator can be\nused in the comparison with CPAT. Low estimates for price elasticities\nof gasoline in road transport are however very established in the\nliterature. A recent survey, Galindo et al (2015), indicated -0.10 and\n-0.30 for short- and long-term elasticities, respectively, with our\nestimate (-0.19) falling right in the middle of this range.\n\nThe difference between elasticities estimated here and those used in\nCPAT is noticeable in the case of the Service sector. CPAT postulates\nfuel consumption being more price responsive than demand in industrial\nsector while our estimates point at elasticities being similar to those\nestimated in the residential sector. Assuming that there is considerable\noverlap between fuel uses in the service sector and in households (space\nheating, air conditioning and everyday electrical appliances), our\nfindings of similar elasticities in the service and the residential\nsector seem plausible. Considering the difference between our estimates\nand CPAT and the growing importance of the service sector globally, this\nis a topic which should be explored further in the next iteration of\nCPAT.\n\n![](./03/media/image46.png)\n\nFigure 3‑37 Comparison between price elasticities used in CPAT and those\nestimated in this study for transport ( A), residential (B), industrial\n(C) and service (D) sectors. The red triangles indicate an estimate\nobtained from one of the adopted estimators, while the blue triangles\nindicate the value of the elasticity used in CPAT. The boxplot in\nsubplot C indicates the range of the estimates obtained for the\nindustrial subsectors included in the study.\n\n##### Elasticities with respect to economic activity\n\nFigure 3‑38 compares the estimates of the elasticities with respect to\neconomic activity with the values used in CPAT for the transport\n(quadrant A), residential (quadrant B), industrial (C) and the service\nsector (D). Estimated elasticities are similar to those in CPAT in the\ncase of the:\n\n  - residential sector, with the exception of electricity for which we\n    estimated a relatively low (0.16) value compared to the value (0.65)\n    used in CPAT;\n\n  - industrial sector, with the of exception of natural gas for which\n    CPAT uses a value of 0.81 while estimates here range between 0.33\n    and 0.56.\n\nDifferences still emerge in the transport (quadrant A) and in the\nservice sector (quadrant D). With regard to the former, our estimates\n(ranging between 0.31 and 0.53 across fuels) are close to the results\nfrom the meta-analysis in Galindo et al (2015) indicating short- and\nlong-run income elasticities equal to 0.26 and 0.46, respectively. CPAT\nis currently using the higher value of 0.57 for gasoline and 0.65 for\nother oil products. With regard to the service sector, CPAT incorporates\na stark difference between elasticities for biomass and diesel (with\nvalues up to 0.41) and those for electricity and natural gas (with\nelasticity as high as 0.9). In contrast, our estimates are more\nhomogeneous across fuels with values at most as high as 0.7.\n\n![](./03/media/image47.png)\n\nFigure 3‑38: Comparison between income elasticities used in CPAT and\nthose estimated in this study for Transport (A), Residential (B),\nIndustrial (C) and Service (D) sectors. The red triangles indicate an\nestimate obtained from one of the adopted estimators, while the blue\ntriangles indicate the value of the elasticity used in CPAT. The boxplot\nin subplot C indicates the range of the estimates obtained for the\nindustrial subsectors included in the study.\n\n##### Linear trend\n\nCPAT includes a term called “annual autonomous improvement in\nefficiency” which conveys the annual percentage reductions in fuel\nconsumption due to increasing energy efficiency. The intensity of this\nfactor is stronger in the case of transport (average of about -0.5%\nacross fuels) compared to the other sectors for which average for each\nfuel varies between -0.27 and -0.06%\n\nOur estimate of a global linear trend for the sector-fuel combinations\nincluded in this study presents quite a different picture, as a negative\ntrend in consumption could be estimated only for coal and other oil\nproducts. In the case of biomass, electricity and natural gas the trend\nis positive. In the case of diesel and gasoline consumption in the\ntransport sector, not reported in Figure 3‑39, the estimated models\npointed out at non-statistically significant linear trend.\n\n![](./03/media/image48.png)\n\nFigure 3‑39: Comparison between the assumed annual autonomous\nimprovement in efficiency in CPAT and the global linear trend estimated\nin this study. The red triangles indicate the average of the estimates\nfrom the models allowing for a global linear trend.\n\n#### Conclusions and areas for improvement\n\nThe empirical validation pointed out that the elasticities with respect\nto price and economic activity in CPAT tend to be on the same ballpark\nas those estimated here, with some exceptions mainly related to road\ntransport and the service sector.\n\nThis exercise pointed out that estimated global linear trends are\nconsiderably different from the assumed impact of energy efficiency used\nin CPAT. With hindsight, this is not surprising, as estimated global\nlinear trends include the impact of energy efficiency but also changing\npreferences for a specific fuel or the impact of changing sector\ndecomposition. As an example, one would expect a positive linear trend\nin the case of biofuels in the transport sector due to the impact of\npolicies facilitating substitution away from fossil fuels to renewable\nsources. CPAT might benefit from continuing to disentangle the perceived\nimpact of energy efficiency (as currently done) especially if that\ncoefficient could be linked to explicit policymaking.\n\nThis empirical validation has provided an opportunity for a thorough\nassessment of CPAT and how econometric analysis may inform values used\nin the model. This resulted in a number of considerations that will be\nexplored in the next iteration of model development. In particular, CPAT\nis likely to benefit from including:\n\n  - Elasticities estimated on an extensive dataset spanning about 4\n    decades which has been recently put together. Although this is a key\n    development allowing the implementing of more sophisticated\n    approaches and functional forms described below, as a first step, it\n    seems helpful to focus on the estimators considered in this note.\n\n  - A more focused measure of economic activity. The use of GDP to\n    measures economic activity for each sector included in CPAT is not\n    supported by best practice in the energy literature and involves the\n    risk of producing unstable estimates, and therefore forecasts. As an\n    example, if the share of a sector’s economic activity in the whole\n    economy changes in a specific direction, CPAT would under- or\n    over-forecast fuel consumption in that sector. As historical data\n    for more focused economic activity indicators are available for all\n    sectors in CPAT, one would need to assess whether one could obtain\n    forecast time series which are needed by the model to make this\n    approach feasible.\n\n  - A more explicit treatment of long-run estimates. CPAT can\n    incorporate the long-run / short-run distinction explicitly through\n    an Error Correction Model (ECM) specification which is included in\n    the macro-economic model of the World Bank or - perhaps more simply\n    - maintain its current specification but include two sets of\n    elasticities, one for long-run and the other for short-run\n    forecasts, with the timing of the switch between the two informed by\n    empirical evidence.\n\n  - A more explicit analysis of the impact of cross-price elasticities.\n    This is a very important factor for a model assessing consumption\n    for each fuel like CPAT. Systematic approaches to fuel substitution\n    bring their own set of challenges (Agnolucci and De Lipsis 2020), to\n    the extent that a simpler ad-hoc method may be preferable at least\n    as a starting point, perhaps focused only on the substitution of\n    specific fuels in specific sectors.\n\n  - Exploring feedback mechanisms between the variables incorporated in\n    the model and their possible endogeneity. This does not seem a\n    considerable concern considering the variables currently used in\n    CPAT but may deserve its own empirical exploration if more focused\n    indicators of economic activity (as consequence of point 2 and more\n    likely to be endogenous) are used in the model.\n\n  - Assessing the extent to which elasticities vary across sectors and\n    countries. The current version of CPAT includes the possibility of\n    differentiating elasticities with respect to price and economic\n    activity based on whether a sector is in a country belonging to the\n    Lower Income, Lower Middle Income and Upper Middle-Income group on\n    one side, and High-Income Country. The next phase of model\n    development should thoroughly explore this possible source of\n    heterogeneity alongside other sources, e.g. the possibility of\n    allowing heterogeneous responses across industrial subsectors.\n\n  - Trying to disentangle the impact of energy efficiency from changing\n    preferences for a specific fuel, either through variables related to\n    explicit policymaking or incorporating evidence from specific policy\n    events\n\n#### References\n\n1.

We will therefore:\n\n1.  Compare CPAT’s baseline results against Enerdata and the IEA;[^3_49]\n2.  Assess the sensitivity to carbon price against the Enerdata POLES\n    model;\n3.  Put the two together: compare CPAT time trend for different carbon\n    prices vs alternative models.\n4.  Explore the power sector results compated against selected results\n    from EPM\n\n#### Baseline validation\n\nThis section is dedicated to the assessment of the CPAT baseline\nresults. The latter is observed and compared with other models/sources\nthrough time series. We use two sources for comparison. The first and\nmain source used is the Stated Policies (STEPS) scenario of the IEA\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021, extracted from RFF’s Global Energy Outlook\n2022 database. The second source used for comparison is Enerdata’s\nlong-term Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC).\n\nIn both cases, the comparison is established based on specific\nindicators available in the different datasets (from Enerdata and from\nthe IEA). We will therefore challenge both Average and Engineer models\nof CPAT.\n\n##### Comparison with the STEPS scenario of the IEA\n\nThe IEA’s STEPS scenario reflects current policy settings based on a\nsector-by-sector assessment of the specific policies that are in place,\nas well as those that have been announced by governments around the\nworld.\n\nData for solar has been added manually from the IEA WEO 2021 as it was\nnot included originally in the RFF dataset.\n\nWe only have 3 points of data from the IEA: 2019, 2020, and 2030. The\nindicators selected are: Total CO2 emissions, Primary energy consumption\nby fuel, and Electricity generation by fuel.\n\nOverall, the comparison shows comparable results between CPAT and the\nIEA STEPS scenario. Indeed the figures below suggest outcomes of same\norder of magnitude for the observed year (i.e. 2019, 2020 and 2021) and\nlong-term projections are similar.\n\n![](./03/media/image49.png)\n\nNote that it is not possible to observe the inflection point in 2022 in\nthe IEA projection, as data point for the year 2022 is not available. As\ndefined by RFF, Primary energy consumption displays the estimated energy\ncontent of fuels consumed prior to any conversion process.\n\n![](./03/media/image50.png)\n\nOil in CPAT is the aggregation of Diesel, Gasoline, LPG, Kerosene, and\nOther Oil Products. A different aggregation could explain the difference\nobserved in order of magnitude for Oil.\n\n![](./03/media/image51.png)\n\nIn Europe and Eurasia, discrepancies are mainly driven by the results of\nRussia. It is important to note that there is no data for Solar\nElectricity Generation per country in the RFF-GEO dataset for the IEA\nSTEPS scenario. Strong divergence should be noted between the two models\non the nuclear generation.\n\n![](./03/media/image52.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image53.png)\n\n#### Carbon Price Sensitivity\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is the observation of the evolution of the\nemissions depending on the carbon tax level. We will use the data from\nEnerdata in order to establish the analysis. We are taking into account\nboth Average and Engineer models of CPAT. The graphs are indexed on the\nbaseline scenario, as a 100% of emissions.\n\nWe will only consider 3 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related\nCO2 emissions - Power sector, and GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF. The focus\nis at the world level, for the year 2030. We see good alignment between\nthe two models for all three indicators and both CPAT power model\nchoices (average or engineer).\n\nNote here we abstract for any differences in baseline. See the previous\nand next sections for that topic.\n\n**Total CO2 emissions**\n\n![](./03/media/image54.png)\n\n**Energy related CO2 emissions - Power sector**\n\n![](./03/media/image55.png)\n\n**  \n**\n\n**Total GHG emissions, exc. LULUCF**\n\n![](./03/media/image56.png)\n\n#### Comparison with Enerdata’s long-term Enerbase scenario\n\n*It should be noted that Enerdata’s scenarios were formed before the\nCovid crisis.*\n\nThis comparison is based on different carbon tax scenarios (including\nthe baseline scenario), target for 2030: 0 USD/tCO2, 20 USD/tCO2, 40\nUSD/tCO2, 60 USD/tCO2, 80 USD/tCO2, 100 USD/tCO2, and 120 USD/tCO2.\nThese scenarios are computed using the average and the engineer models\nof CPAT in order to add another layer of comparison. Enerdata presents\nCO2 MACC, which is going to be used as an equivalent to the target\ncarbon tax. There are 3 points of data: 2025, 2030 and 2035.\n\nWe consider 5 indicators: Total CO2 emissions, Energy related CO2\nemissions - Power sector - Industry - Buildings - Transportation, and\nGHG emissions, exc. LULUCF.\n\nResults show comparable results, with both models having similar slops.\nEnerdata’s outcomes are, however, higher and aligned with pre-covid\nresults of CPAT, suggesting that the Covid adjustment implemented in\nCPAT may explain the difference. In addition, it is worth mentioning\nthat CPAT is calibrated on IEA’s data in the year 2019 to 2021, and\nIEA’s assumptions are less conservative than Enerdata when it comes to\nthe share of coal power plant in the future.\n\n![](./03/media/image57.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image58.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image59.png)\n\nOverall, CPAT’s results are similar to Enerdata’s results. With a few\nexceptions, the figures below report a similar order of magnitude and\ncomparable directions. In this comparison, the average power model of\nCPAT provides closer estimates to Enerdata’s scenarios.\n\n![](./03/media/image60.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image61.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image62.png)\n\nThe figures below compare CPAT’s **GHG emissions (exc. LULUCF)** against\nEnerdata’s results. Similarly, outcomes are very close worldwide,\nalthough some discrepancies are observed in some regions.\n\n![](./03/media/image63.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image64.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image65.png)\n\n#### Power sector comparison vs. EPM\n\nThe power sector validation is made using the World Bank’s EPM model.\nThe World Bank’s Electricity Planning Model (EPM) is a long-term,\nmulti-year, multi-zone capacity expansion and dispatch model. The\nobjective of the model is to minimize the sum of fixed (including\nannualized capital costs) and variable generation costs (discounted for\ntime) for all zones and all years considered, subject to:\n\n  - Demand equals the sum of generation and non-served energy\n  - Available capacity is existing capacity plus new capacity minus\n    retired capacity\n  - Generation does not exceed the max and min output limits of the\n    units\n  - Generation is constrained by ramping limits\n  - Spinning reserves are committed every hour to compensate forecasting\n    errors\n  - renewable generation constrained by wind and solar hourly\n    availability\n  - Excess energy can be stored in storage units to be released later or\n    traded between the other zones\n  - Transmission network topology and transmission line thermal limits\n\nThe model is an abstract representation of the real power systems with\ncertain limitations. EPM is used mostly to perform least cost expansion\nplans as well as dispatch analyses.\n\n##### Objectives\n\nThe main objective of this analysis is to validate the accuracy of the\nCPAT results by comparing them with selected results from the EPM model,\nfor different countries. The following outputs are compared:\n\n  - Electricity Demand\n\n  - Electricity Generation\n\n  - New Investments\n\n##### Methodology\n\nThe EPM model presents several different scenarios per country. Each\nscenario is defined by a 2030 carbon budget, most of the time defined as\na 40% emission reduction relative to the BAU scenario. However, while\nthe carbon budget is an input for the EPM model, it is an output for\nCPAT. Therefore, we used a goal seek in order to define a 2030 target\ncarbon price in CPAT, which brought us to $40 t/CO2. This is an only\napproximately equivalent comparison: exact matching was difficult.\n\n**We use the Engineer model of CPAT for the entire comparison.**\n\n##### Caveats\n\nPlease note the following caveats on the approach followed:\n\n  - EPM has a constraint in emissions and look to 2040 (80% emission\n    reduction relative to BAU on average), but we work with 2030. In\n    other words, we use a proportional ratio to set the target goal\n    seek.\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n  - The fuel classification in CPAT does not exactly match the EPM ones.\n    Therefore EPM “Fuel oil” will be considered as CPAT “Other oil\n    products” (“Oil” in the legend), EPM “Onshore wind” and “Offshore\n    wind” will be considered as CPAT “Wind”, and EPM “Geothermal” as\n    CPAT “Other RE”. Storage is invested in CPAT but not reported so we\n    do not compare it here.\n\n  - CPAT’s New Investments (MW) are considered spreaded in time, which\n    explains their continuous aspect.\n\n##### Comparison\n\nThe comparison in terms on types of fuels in the energy mix and the\norder of magnitude of the shares reflect similar results. It is worth\nnoting that the EPM model shows a higher share of wind in the\nelectricity generation for some countries (e.g. Vietnam).\n\nIt is however more complicated to establish parallels in the case of\ndeveloping countries, as EPM can suggest discontinuous\ngeneration/investments.\n\n##### Graphs\n\nThe following pages show, for a number of mostly African countries\navailable in the EPM dataset, comparisons for the larger countries\nbetween CPAT and EPM of:\n\n1.  Overall electricity demand.\n\n2.  Electricity generation by generation type.\n\n3.  New investment by fuel type.\n\nComparison for a bigger set of countries, including smaller countries\nthan previously, are available in the Appendix H.\n\n##### Electricity Demand Comparison\n\n![](./03/media/image66.png)\n\n> ![](./03/media/image67.png)\n\n##### Electricity Generation By Fuel Type\n\n![](./03/media/image68.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image69.png)\n\n##### New Investments By Fuel Type\n\n![](./03/media/image70.png)\n\n![](./03/media/image71.png)\n\n### Ex-post studies\n\n#### How effective is the carbon pricing, really? A literature review\n\nDespite voluminous literature on the carbon tax, few empirical works\nhave investigated the effectiveness of a carbon tax and ETS in reducing\nemissions. Figure 3‑40 provides a first attempt to compare the estimates\naccording to three different methods employed in the literature, that is\ncounterfactual scenario and the estimation of semi-elasticity. It is\nworth noting that this comparison might be imperfect as under a\ncounterfactual scenario some estimates have been annualized based on the\npolicy implementation window, similarly to Green (2021). Moreover,\nFigure 3‑40 reports both short- and long-term estimates.\n\nTwo main key findings stand out from ex-post quantitative assessments of\ncarbon pricing policies since 1990.\n\nFirst, experience with carbon pricing and hence the empirical evidence\nis primarily from developed and emerging economies. In particular,\nstudies assessing the effectiveness of a carbon tax focus on OECD\ncountries or Northern European countries, which implemented a carbon tax\nearlier and for which time series data are available. Only few recent\nstudies evaluate ex-post estimates of the effects of carbon tax on CO2\nemissions across the world. At the national level, particular emphasis\nis placed on British Columbia, Sweden and the United-Kingdom. With\nrespect to the assessment of the ETS, the focus is, not surprisingly, on\nthe EU, China, Germany and the United States.\n\nSecond, the estimates for overall emission reductions from carbon\npricing are minimal to modest, falling in the range of 0 – 2 percent per\nannum, with significant variations across sectors, but also across\ncountries (Green, 2021).\n\nNonetheless, several caveats have to be factored in before drawing\nconclusion:\n\n  - **Carbon prices so far have had low coverage, low prices, or both**.\n    The sample size as well as the time horizon might still be too\n    restricted to accurately examine the effect of a carbon pricing\n    instrument. In this respect, empirical results acknowledge that the\n    effects of taxes on emission reductions largely depend on the\n    comprehensiveness of the instrument design and the level of the\n    carbon tax (Metcalf, 2021).\n\n  - **The carbon price appears to have a non-linear effect**, indicating\n    that its effect becomes stronger above a certain threshold (Aydin &\n    Esen, 2018). For instance, emissions reductions attributable to the\n    EU ETS during the second phase (2008-2012) are greater than during\n    the first stage (2005-2007). In the first phase, allowances were\n    freely allocated. In the second phase, the cap was tightened and\n    prices higher.\n\n  - **Control variables introduced in empirical studies may poorly\n    capture the effect of the instrument alone**. At the same time,\n    isolating the effect of the carbon pricing instrument from other\n    policies - which are not always considered as environmental policy\n    measures - may lead to insignificant results. However, evaluating a\n    carbon pricing instrument in conjunction with other instruments can\n    lead to effectiveness (see, for example, Shmelev & Speck, 2018, who\n    find that a carbon tax is effective when evaluated with a set of\n    policies).\n\n  - **The effects of rational ignorance may kick in and eliminate any\n    impact**. Given the transaction costs of investing in low-carbon\n    technologies, agents may not be responsive to a price signal set\n    below a certain threshold.\n\n  - **When it comes to the ETS, generalized free allocation can mitigate\n    incentives** (e.g., through the creation of resource rents and\n    barriers to entry). In addition, as more and more emissions are\n    covered by ETSs (such as in China or in the EU) uncertainty on\n    future prices may blunt the responsiveness of agents.\n\n![](./03/media/image72.png)\n\nFigure 3‑40: Effects of carbon pricing instruments on average annual\nemission reductions: A literature review.\n\nNotes: The numbers correspond to studies listed in the reference section\n(Section 3.8.4.3). Study estimates are adjusted to derive annual\nemission reduction effects of the carbon tax and the ETS to make\nestimates comparable. ST = Short-Term semi-elasticity; LT = Long-term\nsemi-elasticity; CA-BC = British Columbia (Canada)\n\n#### How does CPAT compare to the literature?\n\nIn order to compare CPAT’s semi-elasticity of CO2 emissions against the\nliterature, the following settings are used:\n\n  - Due to low carbon prices, we employ a low step function, that is\n    **$10 per ton of CO2**. Such a step function is comparable to\n    studies estimating semi-elasticities.\n\n  - The model is run for all countries for which data are available and\n    factors in the total CO2 emissions of **171 countries**.\n\n  - As CPAT is forward-looking, it covers the period **2019-2035**.\n\n  - As most of studies analyzed their results against a counterfactual\n    scenario, CO2 emission changes in CPAT are compared to the baseline\n    scenario. The estimation of the short- and long- term\n    semi-elasticities is calculated as follows:\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n  - The total CO2 emissions in ton/CO2 are retrieved from CPAT under the\n    baseline and policy scenarios over the period 2019-2035.\n  - Annual changes are thus computed between the baseline and the policy\n    scenarios.\n  - **Short-term semi-elasticities** are arbitrarily calculated as an\n    average of the annual changes over the period 2019-2023.\n  - **Long-term semi-elasticities** are estimated as an average of the\n    annual changes over the entire period (i.e. from 2019 to 2035).\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n5.  Finally, CPAT holds the advantage to compare C02 emission changes\n    **across sectors (i.e. industry, power, residential and\n    transport)**.\n\nThe table below presents the results. Long-term semi-elasticities are\ngreater than short-term ones, indicating that changes that are not\npossible in a short period of time are more realistic over a longer time\nperiod. When looking into the range of CPAT’s estimates across all\nsectors, results are comparable with those of the literature (see Figure\n3‑40 above). At the sector level, the power sector records the highest\ndecrease on the long run, which is consistent with Rafaty et\nal. (2020)[^3_50].\n\nTable 3‑9: Short- and long-term semi-elasticities of CO2 emission in\nCPAT\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sector</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Short-term semi-elasticities</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Long-term semi-elasticities</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>All sectors</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-2.4%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-6.2%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Industry</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-2.7%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-6.2%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Power sector</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-2.3%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-8.4%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Residential</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-2.2%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-4.9%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Transport</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-0.9%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>-2.0%</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n#### References\n\n1\\.

It searches to evaluate the performance of the used\nassumptions when trying to reproduce historical information. In short,\nthe process assumes an historical point in time as its base year, and\nprojects all relevant variables. Key indicators are selected and their\nprojections are compared to real/observed data.\n\n#### Methodology\n\nThe current results were obtained using a hindcastable version of CPAT\n(CPAT 1.0pre\\_043) with the help of the Multiscenario tool (MT v219).\nThis is an out-of-sample forecasting exercise that simulates data from\nthe year 2000 onward. The analysis uses CPAT methods to forecasts\ndomestic prices, energy consumption and resulting emissions. Observed\ninternational prices for the forecasted period were fed as inputs to the\nsimulation.\n\nAt the first stage, the focus is set on the forecasts of emissions; in\nparticular, on GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) and on energy-related CO2\nemissions. The scenarios are run using six countries as test samples:\n\n  - Australia (AUS)\n  - Brazil (BRA)\n  - China (CHN)\n  - South Africa (ZAF)\n  - United Kingdom (GBR)\n  - United States (USA)\n\n**No Policy interventions were modeled**, so the results correspond to\nthe ‘Baseline’ output of the model.\n\nThe hindcasting exercise relies on an adapted version of CPAT and the MT\nfiles, where the first year of calculations is set to an historical\npoint in time. All relevant data tables (e.g. energy consumption and\ndomestic energy prices) are provided for that same base year. The\nexercise focuses on testing emissions projections, and hence not all\nfeatures of CPAT are used.\n\nThe analysis covers annual data from 2000 to 2017, and assumes that\nconsumption of a fuel in a given sector is a function of sector-specific\nfuel prices and overall level of economic activity, as measure by the\nGDP. Default settings and no-policy interventions are used for\nsimulations.\n\nThe exercise consists of projecting key modeled variables and comparing\nthose simulations with observed information. The checks are done on a\ncountry level basis, with a subset of those being presented here as a\nsample of results. Results are presented by means of figures, and tables\nof key statistics, namely the Root Mean Square error (RMSE) and its\nnormalized version.[^3_51]\n\n#### Comparing projected emissions across selected countries\n\nFor the selection of countries, CPAT has been able to capture the global\ntrend in emissions. However, there are periods where the volatility of\nprojections is larger than that of observed data, and where local\ntrends, and in particular levels, are not properly captured. For a fixed\nset of elasticities, this gaps with respect to observed historical\ninformation can result from projected prices showing higher volatility\nthan observed ones. This is explored in a subsequent stage.\n\n##### GHG (excl. LULUCF)\n\nCPAT shows a good performance on projecting the trend of emissions in\nmost tested countries. A deeper look at the vertical axis’ scale of each\nplot will show periods of increasing gaps between projected and observed\nemissions. For a given set of price elasticities of demand, this could\nbe explained by an inverse gap in projected versus observed domestic\nprices.\n\n![](./03/media/image73.png)\n\nFigure 3‑41: Total GHG (mt.CO2e) excluding LULUCF\n\nTable 3‑10 RMSE and Normalized RMSE .

It follows that,\ngiven the negative price elasticity of demand, an over-estimation\n(under-estimation) of prices with respect to the ones observed in\nreality, may lead to an under-estimation (over-estimation) of energy\nconsumption, and hence emissions. The case of China, is a clear example\nof this. Projected prices are below observed historical ones. Since\nelasticities were computed based on historical prices, this results in\nhigher hindcasted emissions than observed.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the case of the UK escapes this\nexplanation. The hindcasting tool projects lower emissions despite the\nlower modeled domestic prices. This gap in projected emissions would be\namplified if considering in the model the policies that the UK\nimplemented in the mid 2010s. These discrepancies remain for further\nanalysis.\n\nThe tracking of historical information by the simulations may also be\nimproved when setting short and long-term elasticities to model the\nenergy consumption behavior. The current exercise only considers the\nformer, and leaves the latter for further research.\n\nAs an additional remark, by construction, CPAT domestic prices for\nfossil fuels track international market prices for these fuels, and are\nadjusted with the help of an historical factor. The factor helps tame\nthe volatility. However, for some countries, domestic observed prices\nremain smoother than projected ones. This may follow as well from\npolicies like existing price regulations, not modeled in the current\nruns, and also left for further research.\n\n##### Coal prices (historical vs CPAT)\n\n![](./03/media/image75.png)\n\nFigure 3‑43: Domestic retail prices of coal used in the power sector\n\nTable 3‑12 RMSE and Normalized RMSE.

The set of figures below, shows this through the\ndistribution of the relative difference (Projections/Observed), and its\nconcentration under the value of “1”.\n\nA subset of years is taken as a reference, but the behavior is\nconsistent for all years. This reinforces the idea that a second set of\nprice elasticities of demand based on price projections may be needed.\n\n![](./03/media/image77.png)\n\nFigure 3‑45: Coal prices, relative differences: $CPAT projection$ /\n$Observed domestic prices$\n\n#### Conclusions and additional analysis needed\n\nThe hindcasting exercise was focused on projecting emissions (GHG and\nenergy-related CO2). It consists of a partial hindcasting, as the\ninternational prices used as inputs correspond to the outturn of prices\n(observed), instead of projections of prices dating from before the base\nyear selected. It can, hence, serve to better study how the forecasting\nof domestic prices takes place once the true values of some inputs are\nknown.\n\nFor the countries analyzed, CPAT generally shows a good performance\ncapturing the historical trends of the respective variables. In most\ncases, however, the volatility of observed data is not replicated with\nCPAT projections. Moreover, depending on the country, CPAT’s projections\nappear to be persistently under (over) estimating values with respect to\nhistorical ones. While this may result from the implementation of\npolicies that were not modeled in the exercise, it can also result from\ndiscrepancies in price forecasting, and may be subject to additional\ncountry-specific adjustments.\n\n### Parameter Sensitivity Analysis\n\n#### Objectives\n\nThe parameter sensitivity analysis explores the sensitivity of a set of\nselected parameters with regard to:\n\n  - The power sector assumptions;\n  - Macroeconomic adjustments;\n  - Elasticity adjustments; and\n  - Price source adjustments.\n\nThe analysis aims to propose a classification of the sensitivity of the\nparameters, i.e. how CPAT behaves when changing the default parameters,\nand more especially how the change in parameters affects the emissions’\nreductions.\n\n#### Methodology\n\nIn order to test the sensitivity of the parameters, the following steps\nwere performed:\n\n  - **Settings**. Default parameters are used for G20 countries and for\n    a carbon tax increasing from 10$ to 75$.\n\n  - **Model run**. The MT is run using the same defaults but changing\n    one parameter only.\n\n  - **Data**. The database is then compiled, retaining CPAT’s output on\n    emissions for G20 countries.\n\n  - **Computation**.\n    \n    1.  Change in Emissions: Carbon Tax $75 in 2030 vs Baseline\n    2.  Relative change (i.e. to the default parameter) in percentage\n        points (pp). The difference between the change of CO2 emissions\n        recorded under the default setting and the change in CO2\n        emissions under the other options is computed in order to\n        analyse how each option is sensitive to the baseline parameter.\n\n  - **Output**. Create a sensitivity classification of parameters\n    affecting CPAT’s behavior (no\n    sensitivity/negligible/sensitivity/high sensitivity).\n\n#### Results\n\nBased on the methodology described above, the sensitivity of the\nparameters to CPAT to CO2 emissions varies from **no effect to very\nsensitive** when focusing on the relative changes (i.e. CO2 emissions\nreduction relative to the default parameter). The following\nrule-of-thumb is used to classify the sensitivity of the parameters:\n\n  - No effect: no variation\n  - Negligible: less than 2 percentage points\n  - Sensitivity: between 2 and 5 percentage points\n  - High sensitivity: more than 5 percentage points\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of the sensitivity analysis.\n\nTable 3‑: CPAT’s parameters sensitivity results\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Change in Emissions: Carbon Tax $75 in 2030 vs Baseline</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Relative change (i.e. to the default parameter) in percentage points (pp)</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n<th><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sensitivity</strong></p>\n</blockquote></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Power model</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Average*</p>\n</blockquote></td>\n<td><blockquote>\n<p>Average between the elasticity and engineer models.

We divide all energy flows into three main categories:\n\n  - Raw energy supply,\n  - Energy transformation, and\n  - Final energy consumption.\n\nFor each country $j$, the balancing flow in raw energy supply category\nis Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES), which should be equal to the sum\nof Imports, Production, Exports (negative), Stock changes, International\nmarine bunkers (only on the world level) and International aviation\nbunkers (only on the world level). Stock changes and bunkers were\ncombined in “Stock and bunker changes (STOCKCHA)” flow.\n\n$\\text{TPE}S_{j} = \\text{Productio}n_{j} + \\text{Import}s_{j} - \\text{Export}s_{j} + \\text{STOCKCH}A_{j}$\n\nEnergy transformation category includes the following IEA flows:\ntransformation processes (TOTTRANF, includes electricity generation),\ntransfers (TRANSFER), energy industry own use (OWNUSE), distributional\nlosses (DISTLOSS), and statistical differences (STATDIFF). The balancing\nequation for total final consumption (TFC) is:\n\n$\\text{TF}C_{j} = \\text{TPE}S_{j} + \\text{TOTTRAN}F_{j} + \\text{TRANSFE}R_{j} + \\text{OWNUS}E_{j} + \\text{DISTLOS}S_{j} + \\text{STATDIF}F_{j}$\n\nIn transformation processes, we separate the power sector -\ntransformation of fuels into electricity. We include main activity\nproducer electricity plants, autoproducer electricity plants, main\nactivity producer CHP plants, and autoproducer CHP plants. The main\nsector groups in final energy consumption are:\n\n  - Industry\n  - Transport\n  - Building\n  - Power sector\n\nWe disaggregate transport and industry further to sectors.\n\n![Figure 77: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT](./03/media/image79.png)\n\nFigure 3‑47: Sectors disaggregation in CPAT\n\n#### CPAT fuels and sectors overlap\n\nThe fuels and sectors specified above form an energy balances table in\nthe mitigation module, which shows the amount of fuels consumed by each\nsubsector in industry, transport, residential or other sector for energy\npurposes, and the amount of fuels consumed in the power sector to\ngenerate electricity (see the screenshot).\n\n![Figure 78: Energy Balances](./03/media/image80.png)\n\nFigure 3‑48: Energy Balances\n\nAs the energy balances and prices are the main inputs for the Mitigation\nmodule, it is also essential to understand the overlap between energy\nprices and energy consumption by sector and fuels. The table below\ndepicts the energy consumption table obtained in CPAT following\ntransformations from international sources and CPAT’s own projections.\nFor fossil fuels and electricity we have sector-specific or general\nenergy prices and taxes per energy unit (please see a separate\ndocumentation on CPAT Prices and Taxes), for renewables we use price\nindices instead.\n\nFigure 3‑49 explains the overlap of CPAT energy prices and sectors.\n\n![Figure 79: CPAT energy prices and sectors\noverlap](./03/media/image81.png)\n\nFigure 3‑49: CPAT energy prices and sectors overlap\n\n#### Energy Consumption (EC) construction for CPAT\n\nThe purpose of this section is to present the sequence of processes\napplied to build and project Energy Consumption data in CPAT format,\nthat is also sufficiently derived from original international sources.\nThis process is applied as well to build a set of time series of Energy\nConsumption used for regression analysis and hindcasting.\n\nRaw Inputs:\n\n  - Energy Balances (EB) from IEA (yearly information. 2018 and 2019)\n  - Energy Balances (EB) from Enerdata (yearly information. Last update:\n    2018)\n\nIntermediate inputs:\n\n  - CPAT projected Energy Consumption (EC) (2019)\n  - User defined parameters for projections and for EC adjustment\n\nOutcome:\n\nEnergy Consumption tables created using CPAT own structure, assumptions\nand projections based on raw data published by international databases.\nThe table below depicts an example structure of such table:\n\n![Figure 80: Energy Consumption](./03/media/image82.png)\n\nFigure 3‑50: Energy Consumption\n\nThe CPAT energy consumption projections for the base year include a\nsub-process under which the fuel transformation sector is created. In\nCPAT we transform balances into final energy consumption (buildings,\nindustry, transport, other), power sector (part of energy transformation\nin balances) and fuel transformation. Fuel Transformation sector is\ndetermined by the difference between primary and final energy\nconsumption, subtracting Fuel Transformation in the power sector.\nAdditionally, all oil products plus natural gas are aggregated to avoid\ndealing with negative fuel consumption.\n\nSummary: The following diagram summarizes the process.\n\n![Figure 81: Energy Balances process](./03/media/image83.png)\n\nFigure 3‑51: Energy Balances process\n\n### Appendix C - Prices And Taxes Methodology\n\nEnergy prices and taxes are among the main inputs of the Mitigation\nmodule. They include information on (1) domestic energy prices by fuel\nand sector, (2) governmental price controls, (3) international energy\nprices and forecasts, and (4) existing carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon\ntaxes and ETS). This document reflects the main principles and data\nsources used to build the CPAT Prices and Taxes part of the Mitigation\nmodule and information on assumptions used in calculations and the main\noutputs of the Mitigation module that directly depend on the prices and\ntaxes data.\n\n![Figure 82: Mitigation module scheme: prices and\ntaxes](./03/media/image84.png)\n\nFigure 3‑52: Mitigation module scheme: prices and taxes\n\nThe main data sources for prices and taxes inputs include:\n\n  - For international energy price forecasts: energy price scenarios\n    from the World Bank (Commodity Markets Outlook, “Pink Sheet” data),\n    IMF (World Economy Outlook), IEA (World Energy Outlook), and EIA\n    (International Energy Outlook);\n  - For domestic energy prices and forecasts: historical fuel- and\n    sector-specific prices from Enerdata, IEA, IMF FAD, and other\n    sources;\n  - For current carbon pricing mechanisms: historical and planned carbon\n    taxation or ETS information, mainly based on the Carbon Pricing\n    Dashboard;\n  - For subsidies: IMF Energy Subsidies Template, ODI, other data\n    sources\n\nBased on the historical data and policy specifications, including\nsub-sectoral exemptions, the Mitigation module calculates the changes in\nenergy prices and their impact on energy consumption (please see the\nMitigation module’s documentation for more details). These energy prices\nalso act as an input for other modules, including the distributional\nmodule and the Transport module.\n\nAs one of the outputs, the Mitigation module calculates fiscal revenues\nbased on taxation, price controls, and energy consumption data.\n\n#### User options affecting prices in CPAT\n\nThis section lists the user’s choices and briefly explains how these\nchoices will affect further calculations. For more details, please refer\nto specific parts of this document.\n\n![Figure 83: Dashboard](./03/media/image85.png)\n\nFigure 3‑53: Dashboard\n\n##### Policy coverage and exemptions\n\nThe user can choose what sector and fuel to tax on the Dashboard:\n\n![Figure 84: Dashboard: Policy coverage](./03/media/image86.png)\n\nFigure 3‑54: Dashboard: Policy coverage\n\nAdditionally, the user decides whether to phase out exemptions or not\nand the period to phase out exemptions.\n\n![Figure 85: Dashboard: Exemptions](./03/media/image87.png)\n\nFigure 3‑55: Dashboard: Exemptions\n\nNote: if the fuel is exempt and the phase-out is active, the carbon\npricing policy (new carbon tax or ETS) will increase by 1/n every year\nstarting from the chosen year, where n is the number of years to phase\nout exemptions. The user can trace exemptions in the “New policy\ncoverage: CO2 emissions covered” graph on the Dashboard.\n\n##### Choices of the sources for key inputs\n\nThe user can choose the source for international and domestic energy\nprices:\n\n![Figure 86: Dashboard: Sources for key inputs](./03/media/image88.png)\n\nFigure 3‑56: Dashboard: Sources for key inputs\n\nThe options for key inputs include “manual,” which the user can fill in\na separate “Manual inputs” tab:\n\n![Figure 87: Manual inputs](./03/media/image89.png)\n\nFigure 3‑57: Manual inputs\n\n##### Policy options: Existing carbon pricing policies\n\nThe user can choose to apply existing carbon tax or ETS (if they exist)\non the Dashboard:\n\n![Figure 88: Dashboard: Policy Options](./03/media/image90.png)\n\nFigure 3‑58: Dashboard: Policy Options\n\nThe user also has an option to specify carbon tax or ETS permit price\ngrowth for future years in the “Advanced options” of the Dashboard:\n\n![Figure 89: Dashboard: Advanced Policy Options](./03/media/image91.png)\n\nFigure 3‑59: Dashboard: Advanced Policy Options\n\nNote 1: even if the user decides not to apply existing carbon pricing\nmechanisms, it will not affect historical prices, only forecasted.\n\nNote 2: existing policy coverage for carbon tax and ETS permit prices\nare fractional. When considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing\npolicies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is\naffected by the policy. This differs from the treatment of coverage\nunder the new, user-defined, policies. There, the option to include or\nnot a sector or fuel is binary. For new policies, a fractional coverage\nonly occurs when the user selects to exempt a sector or fuel, and to\nphase out that exemption in time.\n\n##### Policy options: New excise / existing excise exemptions\n\nThe user can add a manual per-unit of energy excise by choosing the “Add\nadditional excise” option on the Dashboard and filling a relevant part\nof the “Manual inputs” tab.\n\n![Figure 90: Manual inputs: Manual Policy\nOptions](./03/media/image92.png)\n\nFigure 3‑60: Manual inputs: Manual Policy Options\n\nThe user also has an option not to apply existing excise taxes starting\nfrom the policy year (existing excises used by default):\n\n![Figure 91: Dashboard: Existing tax removal](./03/media/image93.png)\n\nFigure 3‑61: Dashboard: Existing tax removal\n\nNote 1: if the user decides not to apply existing non-carbon taxes, this\ndecision will affect only policy forecast, not baseline and historical\ndata. Moreover, it the user decides to keep existing policies in place,\nby default those will be projected with the existing sector and fuel\ncoverage and not with the one the user may use for newly-introduced\npolicies.\n\nNote 2: As discussed before, existing policy coverage for carbon tax and\nETS permit prices are fractional, while the coverage for new policies is\nbinary. Indeed, when considering sector and fuel coverage, for existing\npolicies, CPAT accounts for the fraction of the consumption that is\naffected by the policy. This differs from the treatment of coverage\nunder the new, user-defined, policies. There, the option to include or\nnot a sector or fuel is binary. For new policies, a fractional coverage\nonly occurs when the user selects to exempt a sector or fuel, and to\nphase out that exemption in time.\n\n##### Policy options: VAT reforms\n\nThe user can include externalities to be part of the VAT base for\noptimal taxation (included by default):\n\n![Figure 92: Dashboard: VAT Reform](./03/media/image94.png)\n\nFigure 3‑62: Dashboard: VAT Reform\n\nAlso, the user can choose to apply the same VAT tax rate in the\nresidential and transport sectors if it is different from the general\nVAT in the economy (“advanced options” in the Dashboard):\n\n![Figure 93: Dashboard: Adjusting VAT per\nsector](./03/media/image95.png)\n\nFigure 3‑63: Dashboard: Adjusting VAT per sector\n\n##### Fossil fuel subsidies reform\n\nThe user can choose to phase out fossil fuel subsidies (producer- and/or\nconsumer-side) over a specified period (n years). The fossil fuel\nsubsidy will decrease linearly by 1/n every year starting from the year\nthe user chose to start the phase-out until they reach zero or a\nspecified limit.\n\n![Figure 94: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies\nReform](./03/media/image96.png)\n\nFigure 3‑64: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform\n\nAdditionally, the user can choose to phase out only a part of the fossil\nfuel subsidies in the “advanced options” of the Mitigation module.\n\n![Figure 95: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (Advanced\nOptions)](./03/media/image97.png)\n\nFigure 3‑65: Dashboard: Fossil Fuel Subsidies Reform (Advanced Options)\n\n##### Price liberalization\n\nThe user can choose to calculate the impact of the government energy\nprice control in the “advanced options” of the Dashboard and the source\nfor price control coefficients (manual or regional). The choice will not\naffect historical price components but will affect calculations of\nfiscal revenues or losses.\n\n![Figure 96: Dashboard: Price liberalization (Advanced\nOptions)](./03/media/image98.png)\n\nFigure 3‑66: Dashboard: Price liberalization (Advanced Options)\n\nNote. Do not use price liberalization and fossil fuels subsidies phase\nout simultaneously to avoid double-counting.\n\n#### Price components\n\n##### Assumed pricing mechanism\n\nFigure 3‑67 below presents the main components of prices in the\nbaseline.\n\n![Figure 97: Main components of baseline prices](./03/media/image99.png)\n\nFigure 3‑67: Main components of baseline prices\n\n**Supply cost** is an average price that includes all price components\nlike production and transformation costs, transportation and\ndistribution costs, profits, and others, except taxes.\n\n**Retail price** is an average end-user price paid by the final user in\nthe corresponding sector (power generation, industry, transport,\nresidential) per unit of energy, including all applicable taxes and\nsubsidies. According to IEA, the historical retail prices are calculated\nas a ratio of total sales of energy to the sold volume. The retail price\nshould equal the supply cost plus all relevant taxes:\n\n$p_{\\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{tt}x_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n\nwhere $p$ is the average retail price, $\\text{sp}$ is the price\nbefore taxes and $\\text{ttx}$ is the total taxes for country $j$,\nfuel $f$ in sector $s$ and year $t$. This holds for both the\nbaseline and the policy scenarios.\n\nNote: In general, carbon pricing policies and the phasing out of\nconsumer-side subsidies will affect the $\\text{ttx}$ component, while\nthe phasing out of existing producer-side subsidies will instead affect\nthe supply cost $\\text{sp}$.\n\n**Price gap/total taxes/subsidy**: the gap between the supply cost and\nretail price. This is a function of any type of taxation and/or\nsubsidization that causes the supply cost to deviate from the\nimport/export parity price plus mark-ups and the any taxes applied to\nthe price before tax, such as VAT, excise taxes, and other taxes\n(environmental, renewable support taxes, energy security taxes, social\ntaxes, and others). The historical values of $\\text{ttx}$ are\ncalculated in the dataset as a difference between average retail price\nand price before taxes and, thus, are negative in the case of a net\nsubsidy. For forecasted years, the value of $\\text{ttx}$ will instead\nbe computed as the sum of the forecasted subcomponents (different types\nof taxes and consumer-side subsidies).\n\n$\\text{tt}x_{\\text{cgf},t} = p_{\\text{cgf},t} - sp_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n\nwhere $\\text{ttx}$ stands for the total net taxes (or net subsidy if\nnegative), $p$ is the average retail price and $\\text{sp}$ is the\nsupply cost (i.e. the price before tax). By construction, this\nrelationship holds for all scenarios.\n\n**VAT payment**: historical values are calculated in the dataset as VAT\nbase (price before tax plus all other taxes except VAT) multiplied by\nthe VAT rate. The VAT rate is assumed to be 0 for industrial and power\ngeneration users since these users receive a credit on their input VAT.\n\n$\\text{va}t_{c,f,g,t} = \\left( sp_{c,f,g,t} + \\text{tx}o_{c,f,g,t} \\right)*\\text{vatrat}e_{c,f,g,t}$\n\nwhere $\\text{VAT}$ is the VAT payment per energy unit, $\\text{txo}$\nrepresents the excise and other taxes/subsidies and $\\text{VATrate}$\nis the VAT rate.\n\n**Excise and other taxes**: calculated in the historical dataset as a\ndifference between retail price, supply cost, and VAT payment.\n\n$\\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgf},t} = p_{\\text{cgf},t} - sp_{\\text{cgf},t} - \\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n\nFor the forecasted years, instead, it is computed as the sum of its\nprojected components. This, as in the scenarios we decompose the Excise\nand other taxes category to several additional price components, such as\n*current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy, new excise\ntax (if applicable), and fixed/ad-valorem part / other, which includes\nprice controls (if applicable)*.\n\nThese categories (except new policy and new excise tax), being the\nExcise and other taxes category components, do not affect the retail\nprice.\n\n  - Carbon tax/ETS permit price: ‘effective’ carbon tax/ETS permit price\n    as a component of total taxes is calculated separately in CPAT based\n    on existing carbon pricing mechanisms and emission factors. Details\n    are provided below.\n  - New policy/new excise tax: the main driver of the change in retail\n    prices. They are calculated as components of the excise and other\n    categories, depending on the chosen policy (new carbon tax, ETS,\n    road fuel tax, others) and emission factors. By default, in the\n    baseline scenario, new policy/new excise taxes are equal to zero.\n  - Subsidies: per unit of energy subsidy is calculated as a sum of all\n    subsidies over the total final consumption by sectors (power,\n    industry, residential, transport). The details are provided below.\n\n##### Assumptions used for price reconstruction and projections\n\n**Retail prices**:\n\n  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\n  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\n  - Otherwise, calculated as a sum of the supply cost, VAT and other\n    (excise + environmental) taxes\n\n**Supply costs**:\n\n  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\n\n  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\n\n  - Otherwise:\n    \n      - For the first year: if no data whatsoever, uses the global\n        (regional if possible) price\n      - For the second year and after, calculated as the previous year’s\n        supply cost multiplied by the global (regional) prices’ growth\n        rate\n\n**VAT payments**:\n\n  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\n\n  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\n\n  - Otherwise:\n    \n      - For the first year:\n        \n          - For the power and industry sectors, assumes 0\n          - for the residential and “all” sector, calculated as the sum\n            of the supply cost and excise and other taxes multiplied by\n            the general VAT rate in the country\n    \n      - For the second year and after, if no data, uses a proportion to\n        the supply cost with other taxes from the previous year\n\n**Excise and other taxes**:\n\n  - Takes user-provided data if there is any in the ‘manual inputs’ tab\n\n  - Uses CPAT generated prices if the data exist\n\n  - Otherwise, if no data whatsoever: Assumes 0 for the first year, and\n    uses a proportion to the supply cost from the previous year for the\n    second year and after (would be changed later when we’ll have\n    working carbon pricing mechanisms tab)\n\n**Current carbon tax and ETS permit price**: Uses CPAT generated prices\nif the data exist (would be changed later when we’ll have working carbon\npricing mechanisms tab)\n\n#### Forecasted prices (after 2021)\n\n##### Assumptions for forecasted prices\n\n**Retail prices**: Sum of the supply cost and all applicable taxes:\nexcise and other + existing ETS/carbon tax + new ETS/carbon tax\n\n**Supply costs**: Previous year’s supply cost multiplied by the growth\nrate of the respective global fuel prices\n\n**VAT payments**: Ratio of the previous year’s VAT payment to the supply\ncost with excise and other taxes multiplied by the current year’s sum of\nthe supply cost and excise and other taxes (plan: should give the user\nan option to apply VAT before or after taxes)\n\n**Excise and other taxes**:\n\n  - If “fixed” – equals to the previous year’s absolute value of the\n    price gap that is not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax, plus\n    applicable carbon pricing mechanisms (current/new ETS/carbon tax)\n  - If “ad-valorem” – equals to the ratio of the previous year’s part of\n    the price gap that is not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax to\n    the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s supply cost, plus\n    applicable carbon pricing mechanisms (current/new ETS/carbon tax)\n  - Plan: additionally, should be corrected to the price control (as a\n    part of the retail price that the government would change in order\n    to keep the retail price controlled)\n\n**Current carbon tax and ETS permit price**:\n\n  - Values from the “Existing carbon pricing mechanisms (ETSs and carbon\n    taxes) and price controls” New carbon tax and ETS permit price:\n  - Values from the respective scenarios (zeroes for the baseline\n    scenario)\n\n##### Calculations: Modeling assumptions\n\nFor years starting from 2021, the price components are modeled by\nfollowing rules.\n\n**Retail price** for fuel f in sector s in year t is a sum of the supply\ncost and all applicable taxes (VAT payment, excise and other taxes):\n\n$p_{\\text{cgf},t} = sp_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{tx}o_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n\n**Supply cost** for fuel $f$ in sector $s$ in year $t$ is\ncalculated using a coefficient of supply costs to base years (2017-2019)\nto the global prices in the same period, multiplied by the respective\ninternational fuel price in year $t$:\n\n$sp_{\\text{cgf},t} = \\frac{sp_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{gp_{f,t_{0}}}*gp_{\\text{cf},t}$\n\nwhere $sp_{\\text{cgf},t}$ denotes the average supply costs for country\n$j$, fuel $f$ in sector $s$ in base years $b$,\n$gp_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}$ is the average global fuel price in base\nyears, $gp_{\\text{cf},t}$ – global fuel price based on the chosen\ninternational energy price forecast in year $t$. Notice that the\nglobal price for certain fuels change from country to country, as the\nreference market differs.\n\n**Producer-side fossil fuel subsidy** is equal to the previous year’s\nper unit of energy producer-side fossil fuel subsidy unless the user\ndecides to phase out fossil fuels.\n\n**VAT payment** equals the previous year’s VAT payment ratio to the\nsupply cost multiplied by the current year’s supply cost:\n\n$\\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t} = \\frac{\\text{va}t_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n\n**Excise and other taxes** components are decomposed into five\ncategories: current carbon tax, current ETS permit price, new policy\ncomponent, new excise tax, and fixed/ad-valorem part/other taxes.\n\n  - Current carbon tax and ETS permit price: if the user decides to\n    apply existing carbon pricing mechanisms, the values will be\n    calculated based on historical values and planned policies. If a\n    country’s carbon pricing policy is not specified for years after\n    2020, the current carbon tax / ETS permit price per energy unit,\n    $\\text{xcp}$, is calculated as:\n\n> $\\text{xc}p_{\\text{cgf},t} = \\text{xc}t_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{xets}p_{\\text{cgf},t}$\n> \n> $= \\text{xc}t_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{CT}} \\right)^{t - t0} + \\text{xets}p_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{ETS}} \\right)^{t - t_{0}}$\n> \n> $= \\text{XC}T_{c,t_{0}}*ef_{\\text{cgf}}*\\varphi_{\\text{XCT},\\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{CT}} \\right)^{t - t_{0}} + \\text{XETS}P_{c,t_{0}}*ef_{\\text{cgf}}*\\varphi_{\\text{XETS},\\text{cgf},t_{0}}*\\left( 1 + \\delta_{\\text{ETS}} \\right)^{t - t_{0}}$\n\nAs show above, the existing carbon price per energy unit results from\nscaling the existing carbon taxes and ETS permit prices from the base\nyear, $\\text{XCT}$ and $\\text{XETSP}$ respectively, by their\nspecific coverage $\\varphi$, the fuel-sector-specific emissions factor\n$\\text{ef}$, and the user-defined growth rate of the nation-wide price\nfor the forecasted years $\\delta$.\n\n  - New policy component:\n\n$\\text{nc}p_{\\text{cgf},t} = \\text{nc}t_{\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{nets}p_{\\text{cgf},t} = \\text{NC}T_{c,t}*ef_{\\text{cgf}}*\\varphi_{\\text{NCT},\\text{cgf},t} + \\text{NETS}P_{c,t}*ef_{\\text{cgf}}*\\varphi_{\\text{NETS},\\text{cgf},t}$\n\nwhere $\\text{nc}t_{\\text{cgf},t}$ and $\\text{nets}p_{\\text{cgf},t}$\nstand for the new carbon tax per energy unit and the new ETS price per\nenergy unit, respectively. In both cases, the value per energy unit is\nobtained based on the national price per ton of $CO2$\n($\\text{NC}T_{c,t}$ or $\\text{NETS}P_{c,t}$), and scaling it by the\ncountry-sector-fuel specific emission factors, $ef_{\\text{cgf},t}$,\nand the sector-fuel coverage for the new policies within the country in\nquestion ($\\varphi_{\\text{NCT},\\text{cgf},t}$ and\n$\\varphi_{\\text{NETS},\\text{cgf},t}$).\n\nAmong the options available, the user can select the sectors or fuel\nthat will be exempt of the policy implemented, as well as the linear\nphase out of those exemptions, if selected by the user. This is already\nconsidered in the sector-fuel coverage $\\varphi$.\n\n  - **New excise tax**: the user can specify additional per energy unit\n    excise tax in the “Manual inputs” tab.\n\n  - **Fixed/ad-valorem part/other**:\n    \n      - If the country’s taxation regime is “fixed,” this category\n        equals the previous year’s absolute value of the price gap not\n        covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT payment, corrected\n        to price controls.\n    \n      - If the taxation regime in the country is “ad-valorem,” this\n        category is equal to the ratio of the previous year’s part of\n        the price gap not covered by the current ETS/carbon tax and VAT\n        payment to the supply cost, multiplied by the current year’s\n        supply cost, corrected to price controls.\n\n$\\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgf},t} = \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix}\n\\frac{\\text{Σfa}o_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}} & \\text{if\\ fixed} \\\\\n & \\\\\n\\frac{\\text{fa}o_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}{sp_{\\text{cgf},t - 1}}*sp_{\\text{cgf},t} & \\text{if\\ Ad\\ valorem} \\\\\n\\end{matrix} \\right.\\ $\n\nwhere $\\frac{\\text{Σfa}o_{\\text{cgf},t_{0}}}{n_{t_{0}}}$ represents\nthe average value of $\\text{fao}$ during the base years.\n\n#### Power generation costs: ‘Old’ cost model from IMF paper used only in elasticity based power model and only if ‘Old’ costs are selected.\n\nElasticity-based generation costs are defined as follows. The total unit\ncosts of generation (i.e. for each fuel type considered),\n$\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}}$, is estimated as:\n\n$\\text{gn}c_{\\text{ocft}} = \\text{ef}c_{\\text{ocft}} + \\text{nf}c_{\\text{ocft}} + \\text{rp}s_{o,\\text{cgft}} + \\text{nc}t_{P,\\text{cgft}}*\\left( 1 - \\text{te}x_{P,\\text{cft}} \\right)$\n\nwhere:\n\n  - $\\text{ef}c_{\\text{ocft}}$ denotes the effective fuel unit costs\n    (i.e. after autonomous efficiency gains), which is defined as the\n    retail price before any new policies adjusted from the autonomous\n    efficiency improvement in generation.\n  - $\\text{nf}c_{\\text{ocft}}$ is the effective non-fuel unit costs\n    (i.e. after autonomous efficiency gains). For the base year,\n    non-fuel unit cost is assumed as a fixed proportion through the\n    period of costs that are non-fuel, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\text{nf}c_{\\text{ocf},t_{0}} = \\frac{\\text{ef}c_{\\text{ocf},t_{0}}}{\\left( 1 - \\gamma \\right)}*\\gamma$\n\nFor the following years, effective non-fuel unit costs are equal to\neffective non-fuel costs from the previous year, adjusted from the\nautonomous efficiency improvement. – $\\text{rp}s_{o,\\text{cgft}}$\ndenotes the renewable producer subsidies, which only apply to wind,\nsolar, hydro and other renewables.\n\n#### New price target: Goal seek\n\nWhen simulating the introduction of a new ETS permit, CPAT allows the\nuser to define, among others, the year of implementation, the initial\nprice/tax to be considered, and the level at which it should reach in a\n‘target’ year. While still on a development phase, CPAT incorporates a\n‘goal seek’ feature to help the user determine the new policy’s target\nprice based on an goal on the emissions level.\n\n![](./03/media/image100.png)\n\nFigure 3‑68: ETS target price - Goal Seek\n\nLocated to the right of the Advanced Options in the dashboard, the goal\nseek allows the user to input:\n\n  - The sectoral inclusion\n\n  - The proportion of the industrial sector to be covered (if Industry\n    is included)\n\n  - The emissions target (in absolute terms, or the reduction\n    percentage)\n\nThe lower part of the goal seek shows the emissions, by sector, for the\nbaseline and the policy. The ‘Total’ row shows, first, the aggregated\nemissions (considering only the sectors included by the user), second,\nthe emissions goal, and third, the squared difference of emissions\nbetween the baseline and the policy scenario.\n\nWhile the user can apply the goal seek functionality in Excel, the\nalgortihm is not particularly useful in this case, and it is more\nconvenient to test the different target prices manually, step-by-step.\n\nIn brief, once the inputs of the Goal Seek feature are provided, the\nuser should check different alternatives of a target price and evaluate\nhow emissions perform under each one. This simplified tool aims at\ngiving a broad approximation of the price level required to achieve the\nemissions goal for the target year.\n\n### Appendix D - Examples of NDCs calculations\n\n#### Example 1: Paraguay (BaU NDC)\n\nNDC overview:\n\n  - Unconditional target: 10% reduction relative to baseline emissions\n    by 2030\n  - Conditional target: 20% reduction relative to baseline emissions by\n    2030\n  - GHG covered: CO2, CH4, N2O\n  - LULUCF emissions: included\n\nCalculations in CPAT:\n\n  - Baseline GHGs, excl.

Some sections are\n    based on earlier papers by Ian Parry, Simon Black, Karlygash\n    Zhunussova, Nate Vernon, Alexandra Campmas, and Stephen Stretton.\n    Thanks to the whole CPAT team – and, in particular, to Simon Black,\n    Karlygash Zhunussova, Paulina Schulz Antipa, and Samuel Okullo for\n    useful comments, clarifications, and assistance in preparing this\n    paper. CPAT has benefited from the extremely helpful comments of our\n    initial reviewers in early 2021 including, among others, Charl\n    Jooste and Claire Nicolas; thanks also to Claire and Adam Suski for\n    providing EPM comparison data. CPAT relies on the assistance of many\n    parties for data and support, including other WB Global Practices\n    (including Phillip Hannam from Energy GP, who helped develop the\n    techno-economic power model) and other academic groups, including\n    IIASA (who provided emissions factors). Thanks to Dirk Heine,\n    Stephane Hallegatte, Simon Black, and Ian Parry for leadership and\n    direction, and for originating what became CPAT. Thanks also to\n    Somik Lall for leadership and guidance.\n\n[^3_2]:  <sup>∗</sup> Corresponding authors: Alexandra Campmas\n    (<acampmas@worldbank.org>) and Stephen Stretton\n    (<sstretton@worldbank.org>).\n\n[^3_3]:  \n[^3_4]:  Victor Mylonas (WB) is listed on the IMF side reflecting his\n    historical contribution to the mitigation module when working at the\n    IMF.\n\n[^3_5]:  Income and price elasticities are based on a literature review.\n    Income elasticities might depend (implicitly) on the level of GDP\n    per capita (user option).\n\n[^3_6]:  IMF (2019), Fiscal Policies for Paris Climate Strategies, From\n    Principle to Practice\n    $<https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2019/05/01/Fiscal-Policies-for-Paris-Climate-Strategies-from-Principle-to-Practice-46826>$\n\n[^3_7]:  Burke, Paul J., and Zsuzsanna Csereklyei. 2016. “Understanding the\n    Energy-GDP Elasticity: A Sectoral Approach.” Energy Economics 58:\n    199–210. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.07.004.\n\n[^3_8]:  Gertler, Paul J., Orie Shelef, Catherine D.
