With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to sharp\nincreases in inequality and poverty, distributional considerations have\nbecome even more relevant to decision-makers. In the realm of\nenvironmental fiscal reforms, equity and poverty concerns often receive\nmore political attention than in the context of ‘traditional’ fiscal\nreforms. Public acceptance is strongly driven by reforms’ perceived\nfairness and impact on low-income households.[^5_1]\n\nThe Distribution Module of CPAT1.0 aims to inform the spread of the\nimmediate fiscal incidence *across* (vertical distribution) and *within*\n(horizontal distribution) income groups, focusing on consumption effects\nand compensatory schemes. Tax-induced consumer price changes and revenue\nrecycling in the form of direct transfers have been at the center of the\nliterature on fiscal distribution, since such salient, short-term\neffects are arguably the most relevant from a political economy\nperspective.[^5_2]\n\nThe Distribution Module allows the user to estimate the\n<span class=\"underline\">carbon tax incidence on consumption</span>,\ntaking into account the direct effect from the use of fuels, as well as\nthe indirect effect from the consumption of other, non-fuel/-energy\ngoods and services. We follow the standard approach in the literature,\ncombining household budget survey (HBS) information with input-output\n(IO) data, adjusted such that they yield the same effective carbon price\nrevenues as the ones produced by the Mitigation Module.[^5_3]\nCountry-fuel-sector- price increases are based on scenario-specific\nestimates from CPAT’s Mitigation Module. Further, the user is provided\nwith two options to relax the typical IO assumptions of full cost-push\nimpacts and absence of behavioral adjustments. Additionally, there is\none option to rebate the price increases of a country’s primary cooking\nfossil fuel to selected bottom deciles to help prevent them from\nswitching to biomass. Results from the Distribution Module have been\ncross-checked and verified against peer-reviewed country case studies\n(c.f. Table VI-4 in the Appendix).[^5_4]\n\nFour modes of <span class=\"underline\">direct and indirect transfer\nschemes</span> can be simulated, once the user inputs the share of\nrevenues allocated under each scheme type: i) new or existing targeted\ntransfers (for which the user can decide the targeted percentiles, among\nother features); ii) transfers towards public investment in\ninfrastructure access; and iii) scaling up an existing social protection\nscheme (following the targeting of the initial scheme)), and iv)\nreforming countries’ personal income tax (PIT) schemes. The revenue\namounts available for redistribution are based on scenario-specific\nestimates from the Mitigation Module. New or existing targeted transfers\nare universal among the targeted percentiles, while infrastructure\ntransfers are targeted to those households without initial access to\nclean water, affordable electricity, clean sanitation, Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICT), or public transport, based on HBS\nmicrodata. Revenue recycling that increases current public spending is\nproportional to the existing social protection schemes, such as social\nassistance, insurance, or in-kind benefit schemes. Further to the above,\ntransfer scheme targeting is also available for decile-specific\npopulation shares that are below international poverty lines (incomes of\n1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day) via “poverty-conditional cash transfers”.\n\nBoth negative consumption effects as well as positive compensation\nscheme effects are expressed as shares of pre-reform consumption and in\nabsolute, per-capita monetary terms on a decile level, separately for\nthe rural, urban, and overall (or national) populations.[^5_5] For\nvertical distribution graphs, the user can further choose between decile\nmean and median consumption data inputs. Horizontal distribution between\nthe 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of consumption data\ninputs within each decile is available for consumption effects (both\nabsent as well as net of compensation schemes).\n\n### Summary: Distribution Module Overview\n\n#### Problem definition and approach\n\nBoth taxation and spending policies may aim to redistribute in a way\nthat post-tax income equality is ameliorated relative to pre-tax income\nequality, often with a special emphasis on the poorest segments of the\npopulation. Thus, the progressivity or regressivity (that is, the\nvertical incidence of fiscal policy options across income groups) are\npolicy-relevant considerations. In addition, horizontal distribution\n(i.e., distribution within the same income group) has gained increasing\nattention, as the within-income-group spread of the incidence (expressed\nas a share of consumption) has been found to be potentially larger than\nthe spread of incidence across income groups due to heterogeneous\nsocioeconomic conditions.[^5_6] Horizontal distributional policy analysis\nis of particular interest with respect to political economy as well as\npoverty considerations. Identifying the parts of the population which\nwill benefit/pay the most, relative to their income, is crucial to\ndesigning and evaluating any tax or social assistance scheme.\n\nWe measure distributional effects of both tax incidence and revenue\nrecycling in a narrow monetary sense, proxied by relative changes in\nconsumption. Our estimates overstate the negative taxation effects,\nwhile understating the positive effects of climate change mitigation and\ncompensation measures. Specifically, the tax incidence analysis focuses\non the consumption channel, disregarding structural effects on wages and\noverall employment, which may positively outweigh consumption-side\neffects, as they tend to be positive, larger and progressive.[^5_7] In\naddition, we disregard the large health co-benefits from improved air\nand environmental quality as well as reduced traffic accidents, road\ndamage and congestion (please, refer to Technical Appendices of Air\nPollution and Transport Modules for further details).\n\nCPAT’s proposed compensation schemes can facilitate the reduction of\nmore fundamental inequalities, due to their economic co-benefits of\nimproved health, education, and opportunity. in this sense, proxying\ncompensation scheme benefits to households by using their monetary\namounts is an underestimate of said benefits. For example, sustained\nconditional cash transfer programs to poorer households can\nsignificantly improve child health and educational outcomes and, thus,\npromote the formation of human capital.[^5_8] Unconditional cash\ntransfers to the ultra-poor can accelerate the energy transition to\ncleaner fuels and reduce energy poverty.[^5_9] Increasing the quality and\nquantity of and access to infrastructure has been found to significantly\nreduce income inequality, poverty and to accelerate growth.[^5_10]\nFurthermore, scaled-up social protection measures and access to clean\nsanitation or clean energy can have similar positive, long-term effects\nregarding development and human capital outcomes. Finally, improving PIT\nprogressivity has been associated with lower levels of income\ninequality.[^5_11]\n\n#### Functionalities\n\nCPAT’s Distribution Module enables *ex-ante* analyses necessary for\ninformed decision making with respect to how equitable and pro-poor\nenvironmental fiscal reform packages would be across countries. As there\nis no “one-size-fits-all” fiscal reform, the user can choose between\nseveral policy design options, particularly with respect to\ndistributional implications within and across household income groups.\n\nThe Distribution Module includes the following features:\n\n**Tax incidence:**\n\n  - Consumption effect (from direct and indirect energy consumption)\n\n  - Adjustments to consumption effect:\n    \n      - Mitigation-adjusted tax incidence (“behavioral and structural\n        change”)\n    \n      - “Emissions-based adjustment of product price changes” (implied\n        revenues on households from IO data consistent with calculated\n        revenues in Mitigation Module)\n    \n      - Reduced cost pass-through (of energy price increases)\n    \n      - Behavioral adjustments, considering consumption decile-specific\n        price elasticities of demand\n    \n      - Special tax rebate for poor households: exemption of cooking\n        fuels\n\n**Compensatory scheme incidence:**\n\n  - Various transfer schemes:\n    \n      - Targeted transfers (new or existing social protection scheme(s))\n    \n      - Public investment (in infrastructure access spending – e.g.,\n        toward SDGs, proxied as cash\n\n  - Current (non-targeted) spending (e.g., scaling up existing social\n    protection scheme(s))Choice of receiving income percentiles and\n    precision of targeting under “Targeted transfers”\n\n  - Cash transfers to people below poverty line: targeting of\n    decile-specific population that is below international poverty lines\n    (incomes of 1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day)\n\n  - Reduction in PIT liabilities\n\n**Socioeconomic heterogeneity**: results using median/mean HBS\ndecile-level data, across overall, rural and urban (sub-)samples,\nhorizontal/vertical distribution of effects, consumption effects absent\n(and net of) compensation schemes Some features may not be available for\nall countries covered, due to data-related availability constraints. The\nDistribution sheet in CPAT lists the countries available in the Module.\n.\n\nThe full [Guiding Package for CPAT microdata\nharmonization](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/EkSiwIBBzxdGh7jePslDsUMBy-f_rMWlAFgC05Ag1wQ0vQ?e=eegMbF),\ni.e. for preparing a country’s household microdata for inclusion in the\nDistribution Module, includes a Codebook, supplementary Guidebook, as\nwell as two coding templates (in STATA format) containing data\nharmonization, preparation and cleaning processes.\n\n## Household budget survey preparation\n\n**Estimations of the distribution of carbon tax burdens as well as\nrevenue recycling scheme benefits are largely based on microdata in the\nform of national household budget surveys (HBSs). This section describes\nhow the primary household-level data are harmonized and aggregated\nbefore they are incorporated into CPAT.**\n\n### Household budget shares\n\n$\\pi^{\\text{dg}}$is the budget share of expenditures on a given,\ncategory g item by a household in decile d. It represents the\nconsumption as observed in a survey year in a specific country.\nHousehold consumption shares are processed from HBSs, which are\ncountry-specific and heterogenous in terms of structure and coverage.\nWhere possible, CPAT aims to incorporate the latest HBS of the country.\nThis section describes how these shares are calculated.\n\nFirst $C_{j}^{g}$, household j’s annual consumption on expenditure\ncategory g, is estimated from HBSs. There are two types of expenditure\ncategories: i) direct fuel/energy consumption expenditures: electricity,\nnatural gas, gasoline, diesel, coal, oil/lubricants, LPG, kerosene,\ncharcoal, ethanol and firewood (listed in Figure 5‑1) and ii) non-direct\nfuel/energy consumption expenditure[^5_12]: appliances, chemicals,\nclothing, communications, education, food, health services, housing,\npaper, pharmaceuticals and medicine, recreation and tourism,\ntransportation equipment, public transportation, and other expenditures\n(Table 5‑2). Expenditure items in household surveys are mapped to these\nCPAT expenditure categories[^5_13] and aggregated to create household\nconsumption under said categories.\n\nIn addition to budget shares, CPAT captures households’ poverty status\nwith respect to the PPP USD 2011 1.9 and 3.2 daily poverty lines. Dummy\nvariables indicate position with respect to the poverty line(s) based on\nhouseholds’ per capita total consumption including actual (not imputed)\nrent. Poverty incidence is then summed by decile and informs\npoverty-conditional cash transfers CPAT.\n\nSubsequently, household budget shares $\\pi_{j}^{g}\\ $ are calculated\nfor each household *j* from by dividing each household’s consumption of\neach expenditure category *g* by total household consumption\n($C_{j}$). Total consumption (for the purposes of budget share\nestimation) is the sum of consumption in all expenditure categories g,\nwhere the category “housing” (see Table VI-3) does not include imputed\nrent of a dwelling.[^5_14]\n\n$\\pi_{j}^{g} = \\frac{C_{j}^{g}}{C_{j}} = \\ \\frac{C_{j}^{g}}{\\sum_{}^{}C_{j}^{g}}\\ $\n\n(1)\n\nHousehold budget shares $\\pi_{j}^{g}\\ $are aggregated at the household\nper-capita consumption decile to arrive at $\\pi_{}^{\\text{dg}}$.\nHousehold per-capita consumption-based decile generation (as well as any\nassociated percentile statistics) are weighed by the corresponding\nsurvey per-capita population weights (*popw*) to ensure sample\nrepresentativeness at the national level. Household per-capita\nconsumption ($cons\\_ pc)$ for the purposes of decile generation is\ntotal household consumption including imputed rent (*tot\\_cons*) divided\nby household size (*hhsize*): $cons\\_ pc = tot\\_ cons/hhsize$.\nFollowing the literature, CPAT, thus, proxies lifetime income, or\nstandard of living, with consumption expenditures, as they are widely\nconsidered a better proxy for welfare than nominal (e.g., wage)\nincome.[^5_15]\n\n$\\pi_{}^{\\text{dg}}$ is estimated for the overall (i.e., national)\nsample of households as well as separately for urban and rural\nhouseholds. In addition to average household budget shares, the median,\n25<sup>th</sup> percentile, and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile statistics\nare generated for all three samples (overall, urban and rural) at the\ndecile level.\n\n*Outlier treatment*: Any non-missing consumption shares that lie above\nthree (3) standard deviations (SD) of their corresponding\n(popw-weighted) means in each specific expenditure category are treated\nas outliers. The outliers are replaced, by decile, with the decile’s\npopw-weighted mean household consumption share in the specific\nexpenditure category.\n\n*Decile sensitivity check*: Household per-capita consumption deciles are\nbased on total household consumption, including imputed rent. The\nsensitivity of these deciles is checked against the number of households\nshifting deciles when total household consumption is defined as\nexcluding any rent (*tot\\_cons\\_norent in 1*).\n\n### Household infrastructure access\n\nIn addition to household budget shares, indicators for household access\nto infrastructure are generated and used within CPAT.\n$\\digamma_{}^{\\text{di}}$ is the weighted share of households (in\npercent) within decile d which have access to infrastructure category\n*i*. These categories are access to i) water; ii) electricity; iii)\nsanitation; iv) ICT; and v) public transportation (listed and defined in\nTable 5‑3 under “infrastructure access”).\n\nFirst, $\\digamma_{j}^{i}$, a binary variable taking the value of 1 if\na household has access to infrastructure category I (0 otherwise), is\ngenerated for each household j in the HBS. Next,\n$\\digamma_{}^{\\text{di}}$, the popw-weighted average share of\n$\\digamma_{j}^{i}$ , is calculated for each decile. Note that, since\nweights are per capita weights, infrastructure access shares represent\nindividuals (not households). Shares are calculated for the overall,\nurban, and rural sub-samples.\n\n## Microsimulation Method\n\nCPAT’s Distribution Module enables *ex-ante* analysis of distributional\neffects of user-defined environmental fiscal reform packages, focusing\non consumption effects and compensatory schemes (see Figure 5‑1 for an\noverview). Section 5.3.1 outlines the carbon tax incidence analysis,\nsection 5.3.2 presents further options with regard to tax incidence\nestimates; section 5.4 introduces the estimation of compensatory\nschemes, including transfers and reductions in PIT liabilities.\n\n![](./05/media/image1.png)\n\nFigure 5‑1: Overview of the deployed microsimulation approach and\nrespective functionalities. Note: for the first step (calculating direct\nand indirect energy consumption), please refer to section 5.2 Household\ndata preparation.\n\n### Tax incidence analysis\n\nCPAT assesses the consumption incidence of carbon fiscal policies across\ndifferent income groups by means of a microsimulation model. Consumption\neffects are measured as the costs of maintaining pre-reform consumption\n(i.e., households’ additional expenditures), observed from country-level\nHBS data, with the user-defined carbon tax scenario in place. Thus, this\nmicrosimulation focuses on the short-term consumption changes in terms\nof compensating variation, assuming fixed consumption patterns. In other\nwords, households are assumed not to adjust their behavior in response\nto the carbon price, and consumption effects represent upper-bound\nestimates (Dorband et al 2019). Estimating price and income elasticities\nof demand, differentiated across countries, income levels and\nenergy/non-energy products is a data- and resource-intensive task, which\ncan be partly integrated into the analysis via a user option to apply\ndecile-specific price elasticities of demand (based on USDA data[^5_16])\nto said microsimulation estimates (see also Section 4.3.2).\n\nThe **consumer incidence of an energy-based upstream carbon tax** is\ndetermined by the tax-induced price changes of fossil fuels, as well as\nby the direct and indirect energy consumption bundles of households;\nthat is, by households’ direct fuel combustion or use of electricity,\nand the indirect consumption of energy embedded in other goods and\nservices. Thus, the proportion of additional expenditures *P* of\nindividual *j* after the policy intervention is a multiplicative\nfunction of (i) average energy intensities $\\overline{e_{\\text{fg}}}$\n(USD/USD) of fuel *f* of consumption items from each sector *g (note\nthat f* ∈ *g*); (ii) total expenditures $C$*;* and (iii) the tax rate\n*t for fuel f in sector g, expressed as the price increase post- (p2)\nrelative to pre-reform (p1)* (USD<sub>p2</sub>/USD<sub>p1</sub>) (c.f.\nendnote 3).\n\n$p_{j} = \\ \\sum_{\\text{fg}}^{}{p_{\\text{fgj}}\\  = \\ }\\frac{\\sum_{\\text{fg}}^{}{\\overline{e_{\\text{fg}}}\\ *t_{\\text{fg}}*\\ C_{\\text{gj}}}}{C_{j}}$\n, *f* ∈ *g*\n\n*(* *2)*\n\nThe **tax-induced price changes of fossil fuels** (c.f. Table 5‑1 for a\nlist of fuels), which determine households’ additional expenditures on\ndirect fuel consumption (for f=g, in Eq. ( 3)), are a function of fuels’\ncarbon intensities, $e_{f}$, measured by emissions factors, and\npre-existing price distortions in the Mitigation Module. For each\nuser-defined carbon fiscal scenario, price changes are obtained from the\nMitigation Module (see respective Mitigation Module Documentation). As\nprice increases vary for each fuel by sector (due to varying emissions\nfactors and baseline pricing), price changes are estimated for each\ncountry, year and fuel-sector pair $t_{\\text{fg}}$, where “sectors”\nhere are power, industry, and residential. Residential sector fuel price\nchanges are used to calculate the direct consumption effects.\n\nThe **tax-induced price changes of goods and services based on the\ndomestic carbon price**, which determine households’ additional\nexpenditures on indirect fuel consumption (for *f* ∉ *g*, in Eq. ( 4)),\nfollow a standard input-output (IO) approach. Consistent with much of\nthe carbon tax literature, all price increases resulting from the\nuser-defined carbon fiscal reform are expected to be fully passed\nforward, from producers and suppliers to final consumers. Estimated\nconsumer price increases are, thus, absolute upper bounds.[^5_17] Adapted\nfrom basic IO analyses (cf. Leontief, 1986; Minx et al., 2009),\nhousehold energy intensities $\\overline{e_{g}}$ result as entries of\nthe vector:\n\n$e_{g} = f\\left( I - A \\right)^{- 1}$, *f* ∉ g\n\n( 4)\n\nwhere each fossil fuel sector, *f* is a vector assigning an energy\nintensity coefficient to each non-fuel sector. The\n$\\left( I - A \\right)^{- 1}\\ $matrix, or Leontief inverse (cf.\nLeontief, 1986), accounts for all upstream inputs that are required to\nproduce one unit of final demand for each sector. $I$ is the identity\nmatrix and $\\text{A\\ }$is a normalized matrix of technical\ncoefficients based on inter-sectoral commodity flows.\n\nFor **(IO) data**, we use the Global Trade Analysis Project\n(GTAP-10)[^5_18] to compute fossil fuel/energy intensities, and\nrespective price changes for non-fuel sectors. The GTAP-10 database has\nseveral advantages. First, it is a consistent global database which\nharmonizes and scales data for 65 disaggregated sectors (g) and 141\nworld regions to the year 2014. Such harmonized data improve\ncomparability across country-specific results in CPAT. Important for the\nestimation of sectoral effects from country-fuel-sector price changes is\nthat GTAP-10 provides a more granular disaggregation of energy sectors\nthan other global IO data with similar regional coverage (e.g., EORA).\nYet, while CPAT distinguishes between eight fossil fuel/energy carriers,\nGTAP-10 includes only five fossil fuel sectors and electricity (c.f.\nTable 5‑1). Based on the concordance table, for GTAP’s “Petroleum and\ncoke products” (p\\_c) sector, CPAT calculates the weighted average price\nchange, using the economy-wide fuel use volumes of these products (in\nktoe from IEA 2020) as weights.\n\nTable 5‑1: Concordance table of CPAT fossil fuels (with acronyms) to\nGTAP-10 fossil fuel sectors\n\n| **CPAT fossil fuel (f)** | **GTAP10 sector (f)** |\n| ------------------------ | --------------------- |\n| Coal (coa)               | coa                   |\n| Electricity (ely)        | ely                   |\n| Natural gas (nga)        | gas/gdt               |\n| Other oil products (oop) | oil                   |\n| Gasoline (gso)           | p\\_c                  |\n| Diesel (die)             |                       |\n| LPG (lpg)                |                       |\n| Kerosene (ker)           |                       |\n\nFinally, sectoral energy intensities, $e_{g}$, and household\nexpenditures, $C_{\\text{gj}}$, are produced for 14 indirect fuel\nconsumption categories. Household consumption is computed as described\nin section 5.2 from primary HBS data. Individual consumer items reported\nin the surveys are mapped to the respective GTAP sectors, which, in\nturn, are mapped to the 14 consumption categories (c.f. Table 5‑1 for\nconcordance between categories and sectors). Thus, all of the 59\nnon-energy GTAP sectors, which produce end-consumer goods and services,\nare aggregated into 14 average product categories. Groupings are\ndetermined on the grounds of comparable average levels of\nenergy-intensity, as well as to match IEA sectoral definitions used in\nCPAT. For a complete concordance table among relevant sources of data,\nplease, refer to CPAT’s ‘Mapping’ tab. Thus, for each GTAP fuel sector,\n*f*, energy intensities, $e_{g}$ in Eq. ( 4), of the 14 CPAT\nconsumption categories, g, are a weighted average of the energy\nintensities of the respective non-fuel GTAP sectors, weighted by GTAP’s\nhousehold final demand vector, *Y*.\n\nThe CPAT Distribution Module is an improvement over the **standard\napproach in the literature**. CPAT explicitly models a domestic carbon\nprice reform. This means, Leontiefs between fossil fuels and sectors of\nproduction reflect only the domestically burned fuels. ‘Embedded’ fuel\ninputs in imports are not considered in the carbon price-induced price\nchange of goods and services. Particularly in countries with high shares\nof imports in the goods and services consumed domestically, this\napproach may yield lower, but more accurate, results on consumption\nincidence.\n\n### Optional features for tax incidence analysis\n\n#### Mitigation-adjusted tax incidence\n\nThe Module provides the user with an option to roughly assess how the\nconsumption effects would decrease if emissions reductions induced by\nthe carbon price reform were taken into account. This adjustment scales\ndown overall consumer price increases relative to the scheme’s\nmitigation effect, thus relaxing the cost-push assumption. The\nMitigation Module provides estimates of economy-wide GHG emissions\nreductions and tax revenues from carbon taxation over time. As noted\nabove, the sectorally more disaggregated Distribution Module is based on\nIO Leontief production functions. This assumes fixed technical\ncoefficients and, thus, full price pass-through, such that the estimated\ntax incidence is to be understood as an absolute upper bound, or\nshort-term, estimate. CPAT provides the user with an approximate measure\nof the extent to which consumption effects would decrease if behavioral\nresponses and structural change were accounted for: for the (future)\nyear of interest, CPAT compares the tax revenue estimates of the\nelasticities-driven Mitigation Module with the tax revenues of the\nIO-based Distribution Module[^5_19], i.e. the proportion of revenues\nraised after and before taking into account behavioral responses:\n\nLet the economy-wide tax burden, or total tax revenues, estimated in the\nMitigation Module be $P_{M}^{y}$ for year y, and in the Distribution\nModule be $P_{D}^{y}$ ($P_{M}^{y} < \\ P_{D}^{y}\\ $), where:\n\n$P_{D} = \\ \\sum_{j}^{}{p_{j}*C_{j}}$\n\n( 5)\n\nrepresents the total revenues expected based on representative HBS\nconsumption data C<sub>j</sub>. As survey data aggregates usually do not\nmatch national accounts, and as total revenues should compare for the\nyear of interest in the simulation, CPAT scales $P_{D}$ to match the\nnational accounts in the year of interest y (2022 $\\leq$ y $\\leq$\n2030), such that:\n\n$P_{D}^{y} = \\ P_{D}*\\ \\frac{\\text{GDP}^{y}*\\theta_{c}}{\\sum_{}^{}C_{j}}$\n\n( 6)\n\nwhere GDP<sup>y</sup> represents the expected GDP in the year of\ninterest in the simulation and $\\theta_{c}$ represents the final\nconsumption expenditure to GDP ratio for the latest available year from\nWorld Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database.[^5_20] Then,\nthe downward adjustment factor to the tax incidence on consumers,\n$p_{\\text{Adj}}$ follows as:\n\n$p_{\\text{Adj}} = \\ \\frac{P_{D}^{y} - P_{M}^{y}}{P_{D}^{y}}$ ,\n$P_{M}^{y} < \\ P_{D}^{y}$\n\n( 7)\n\nThe adjustment factor $p_{\\text{Adj}}$ is applied homogenously across\nthe population, represented as a positive relative consumption effect in\nCPAT. This approach will be refined in subsequent versions of CPAT:\nestimating with more precision the distributional effects of relaxing\nthe assumption of full pass-through of tax-induced price changes to the\nend-consumer requires sophisticated data on production- and\nconsumption-side energy price elasticities. Within countries, households\nof different income strata consume different product bundles (as\ndiscussed in the extensive literature on Engel Curves). Thus, for a\nthorough distributional analysis one needs to determine: a) how price\nelasticities vary across sectors/products; and b) how price elasticities\nof demand for products vary with income.\n\n#### Decile-specific price elasticities of demand\n\nCPAT allows the user to model short-term adjustments on the demand side\nalone, using decile-, country-, and item-specific price elasticities of\ndemand based on (Muhammad et al., 2011). The price elasticities provided\nare by country and consumption category (COICOP), as well as for high,\nmiddle and low income countries. Based on standard concordance tables\n(ISIC Rev. 4 and CPC 2.1), CPAT maps the elasticities to CPAT\nconsumption categories. CPAT, then, adopts the countries’ elasticity\nreported for the middle deciles and assumes that the upper and lower\ndeciles’ elasticities will deviate from the elasticity reported by the\nsame proportion as the elasticities for low- and high-income countries\ndeviate from that of middle-income countries for each consumption item.\nFollowing the same approach as in the Mitigation Module, the\ncountry-decile-specific price elasticity of demand for consumption\ncategory g, ${\\epsilon_{\\text{use}}}^{g}$ is changing $C_{j}^{g}$ as\nfollows:\n\n$C_{j}^{g}*\\left( \\frac{p_{t}}{p_{t - 1}} \\right)^{\\epsilon_{\\text{use}}}$\n\n( 8)\n\n#### Imperfect pass-through\n\nCPAT also provides the user with the option to allow producers to\nabsorb, i.e. not “pass through”, part of the tax-induced price increase.\nThere is ample evidence that (irrespective of any fuel saving/switching\nbehavior) firms pass forward only a portion of the tax-induced energy\nprice increase.[^5_21] The Distribution Module differentiates\npass-through coefficients for 14 transport and industrial sectors, with\ncoefficients ranging from 0.7 to 0.9, and averaging 0.8. Coefficients\n$\\gamma_{g}\\ $($\\gamma_{g} \\leq 1)$ are applied to the tax rate *t\nfor sector g, expressed as the price increase post- relative to\npre-reform*[^5_22]*, such that the downward-adjusted energy price change*\n${\\ t}_{\\text{fg}}^{*}$ *can be expressed as:*\n\n${\\ t}_{\\text{fg}}^{*} = t_{\\text{fg}}*\\gamma_{g}$\n\n( 9)\n\n#### Emissions-based adjustment of sectoral price changes\n\nAs described above, the incidence of goods’ and services’ price changes\non consumers is based on GTAP-related fuel-sector Leontiefs. Multiplying\nthe Leontief with the respective fuel’s price change, we obtain\n‘indirect’ consumer price changes (in the static option). This\nmultiplication implicitly introduces a price assumption to the GTAP\nmonetary flow of energy: based on observed fuel prices (USD/volume or\nweight of fuel in 2021), the Mitigation Module estimates expected fuel\nprice changes. Thus, this calculation assumes a corresponding energy\nflow. However, this energy flow might not necessarily match the observed\nenergy flow by fuel and sector (which CPAT takes from IEA Energy\nBalances). To correct for this potential imbalance, CPAT allows the user\nto adjust consumer price incidence by theoretical time-zero revenue\nflows from the carbon pricing reform modelled. This means that, using\nthe best available empirical data (IEA Energy Balances, GAINS emissions\nfactors, and IMF combined fuel price data), CPAT calculates the revenues\nthat would be raised if no price-induced adjustments were to take place\n– hence the term time-zero revenues. These theoretical revenue streams\nare calculated by fuel and CPAT sector. The final demand portion of this\nprice incidence on the economy (usually around 60%, as the remainder is\naccounted for by goods which are exported or consumed by government and\nfixed capital formation) is equivalent to the static consumption\nincidence which should be reflected in the analysis. CPAT, thus, allows\nthe user to scale the baseline incidence to this level. If chosen,\nadditional adjustments are, then, calculated using this new baseline.\n\n#### Cooking-fuel adjusted tax incidence\n\nFor selected deciles (starting from the poorest one), CPAT provides the\nuser with the option to exclude from taxation the fossil fuel which is\nused as a primary cooking fuel. The rationale is as follows: when taxing\nprimary cooking fuels (e.g., LPG), there may be a risk of households\nbeing pushed into using traditional, unsustainable biomass (e.g.,\nfirewood or charcoal). Therefore, the user can model distributional\neffects of carbon taxes when households in the bottom (e.g., one or two)\ndeciles do not face an increase in the price of their primary cooking\nfossil fuel. From a policy design standpoint, this option is to be\nunderstood as a rebate. That is, the household will pay the tax when\nbuying the fuel but will receive a compensatory transfer for its cooking\nneeds. Such rebate schemes have received particular attention during\nIndia’s LPG subsidy reform, which implemented the Direct Benefit\nTransfer Scheme for LPG (“Pratyaksha Hastaantarit Laabh (PAHAL)”)\nprogram.[^5_23]\n\nPrimary cooking fossil fuels are identified for each country based on\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) Household Energy Database[^5_24].\nCovering 161 countries, the database collects and harmonizes household\nsurvey data on the portion of the population cooking with each of\nfourteen disaggregated fuels, considering surveys between 1970-2014. For\neach country, and the latest available year of survey data, CPAT\ndetermines which of the eight fossil fuels listed in Table 5‑1 is most\nwidely used for cooking.\n\n## Incidence of compensatory transfers\n\nGiven countries’ heterogeneous development status, and political and\nsocioeconomic realities, the design of environmental fiscal reforms\nvaries widely. CPAT provides the user with various options for recycling\nrevenues from environmental fiscal policy scenarios, including via\ndirect and indirect support schemes. Direct transfer schemes to\nhouseholds provide a particularly suitable instrument for increasing\npublic acceptance of tax reforms. This is because they are salient,\nimmediate, and well-targetable. Additionally, direct transfer programs\nare widely adopted globally, as they have proven to be an effective\nmeans of achieving key development goals, with some of them being more\nadministratively simple to implement, due to digitization.\n\nIn CPAT, the user can choose among three general options for\nredistribution via transfers to households. All three redistribution\noptions are modelled as direct, per capita payments averaged by deciles:\n\n1.  Decile-targeted transfers (new or existing social protection\n    scheme(s))\n\n2.  Public investment (in infrastructure access)\n\n3.  Current spending (e.g., scaling up existing social protection\n    scheme(s))\n\n4.  Labor tax reforms (as personal income tax reforms)\n\n### Targeted and infrastructure-based transfers\n\nBeyond the choice among (*a)-c)* above), the following four parameters\nare user-defined:\n\n1.  the percentage share of total revenues to be used for (new,\n    existing) targeted and/or public spending transfers;\n\n2.  (for new/existing targeted transfers only) the per capita income\n    percentiles to receive the chosen transfer (starting from the bottom\n    of the income distribution; C<sub>jT</sub> $\\leq \\ $p(T)\n    C<sub>j,</sub>);\n\n3.  (for new/existing targeted transfers only) the “coverage rate”, i.e.\n    the share of the population targeted actually receiving the\n    transfer; and\n\n4.  (for new/existing targeted transfers only) the “leakage rate”, i.e.\n    the share of the untargeted population receiving the transfer.\n\nOptions 3. and 4. allow the user to consider imperfect implementation of\ncash transfer schemes, such that parts of the population which would\nqualify for the transfer do not receive it, while other parts of the\npopulation (not qualifying) do so, due to imperfect targeting. Such\nleakage is assumed to be spread equally across the non-targeted\npopulation.\n\nThe amount of the targeted, per capita transfer, T, for the targeted\npopulation, pop<sub>T</sub>, is calculated by dividing total transferred\nrevenues by the total eligible or ‘targeted’ population in the year of\ninterest y, such that:\n\n$T_{}^{y} = \\frac{P_{M}^{y}}{\\text{pop}_{T}^{y}}$\n\n( 10)\n\nWhere the survey population (i.e., the sum of per capita population\nweights)[^5_25] is scaled to match the projected national accounts,\n*pop*, based on the IMF’s 2022 World Economic Outlook vintage, for the\nyear of interest, such that:\n\n$\\text{pop}_{T}^{y} = {(\\sum_{}^{}\\text{popw}}_{T})*\\ \\theta_{\\text{pop}}^{y}\\ $\n\n( 11)\n\nwhere\n\n$\\theta_{\\text{pop}}^{y} = \\ \\frac{\\text{pop}^{y}}{\\sum_{}^{}\\text{popw}}$\n\n( 12)\n\n**New targeted transfers** are conditional on per capita consumption\n(user-choice 2. above). Thus, the average per capita transfer,\n$T_{d\\ }^{y}$, for decile d depends on the portion of the decile\npopulation, $\\text{pop}_{T}^{\\text{dy}}$ , below the targeted\nconsumption threshold (i.e. for which C<sub>jT</sub> $\\leq \\ $p(T)\nC<sub>j</sub>) such that:\n\n$T_{d\\ }^{y} = \\ T_{}^{y}*\\frac{\\sum_{}^{}\\text{pop}_{T}^{\\text{dy}}}{\\sum_{}^{}\\text{pop}_{}^{\\text{dy}}}$\n\n( 13)\n\n**Transfers toward infrastructure access** are received only by those\nindividuals without initial access to infrastructure type i,\n$\\digamma_{j}^{i}$ (refer to section 5.2 for details). The user can\nchoose between five different types of infrastructure provision: CPAT\ndefines infrastructure access in line with the WHO’s WASH database[^5_26]\nand WB WDI database indicators as follows:\n\n1.  Access to improved water source: piped water on premises (piped\n    household water connection located inside the user’s dwelling, plot\n    or yard), other improved drinking water sources public taps or\n    standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected\n    springs, and rainwater collection\n\n2.  Access to improved sanitation facilities: flush/pour flush (to piped\n    sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine), ventilated improved pit\n    (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet\n\n3.  Access to electricity: household connection to\n    local/village/national grid/network; not: battery, generator, PV\n    system\n\n4.  Access to information & communication technology (ICT): ownership of\n    mobile phone/computer, household internet access\n\n5.  Access to public transport\n\nThe portion of the decile population, $\\text{pop}_{T}^{\\text{dy}}$,\nreceiving the transfer, as per Equation ( 13) is calculated based on the\nweighted share of households in decile d who have access to\ninfrastructure category *i,* $\\digamma_{}^{\\text{di}}$, such that\n\n$\\text{pop}_{\\text{Ti}}^{\\text{dy}} = \\ \\sum_{d = 1}^{10}\\text{pop}_{}^{\\text{dy}}*(1 - \\digamma_{}^{\\text{di}})$\n\n( 14)\n\n### Transfers through existing social protection schemes\n\nPolicy makers may favor extending existing social safety nets for the\ntransfer of carbon tax revenues to households. CPAT, thus, provides the\noption to proportionally scale up existing social protection schemes,\nbased on the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and\nEquity (ASPIRE) dataset. For 104 countries, ASPIRE provides\nquintile-level estimates of per capita transfers received through\nvarious benefit schemes, including social assistance measures such as\ntargeted subsidies, in-kind assistance and existing cash transfer\nprograms, labor market protection schemes as well as social insurance\n(please, refer to the ASPIRE documentation for a full catalog of covered\nschemes by country[^5_27]).\n\nAs CPAT simulates a proportional scaling of existing schemes, it first\ndetermines the proportion $\\mathrm{\\Delta}A\\ $by which the protection\nscheme *a* can be scaled up. Following equation ( 10) above, CPAT\ndefines:\n\n${\\mathrm{\\Delta}A}_{a}^{y} = \\frac{P_{M}^{y}}{A_{a}^{y}}$\n\n( 15)\n\nwhere $A_{a}^{y}$ is the inflation-adjusted total government spending\non protection scheme *a* in the year of interest y. For calculating\ntotal government spending, CPAT first multiplies per capita quintile\ntransfer amounts by a fifth of the population pop<sub>y</sub> in the\nyear of interest y, to arrive at total spending by quintile, which is,\nthen, summed up. CPAT arrives at average decile transfers assuming that\nevery two deciles receive the same amount (in per capita terms) as their\ncorresponding quintile (e.g., deciles 1 and 2 receive the per-capita\ntransfer of quintile 1 and so on). The approach described here (in\ntandem with options 1-4 listed under Section 5.4.1 above) also applies\nwhen users choose to recycle carbon tax revenues via existing (as\nopposed to new) targeted transfers.\n\n### Carbon Price Revenue Recycling via Personal Income Tax Reductions\n\n#### Section 1: Data Requirements and Setup\n\nThe distributional effects of carbon price (CP) revenue recycling via\npersonal income tax (PIT) reductions depend on the baseline PIT\nliabilities of individuals at different segments of the income\ndistribution. Broadly speaking, these liabilities are a function of two\ncomponents: taxable (i.e., “gross”) income and PIT schedules. To\ncircumvent the modeling of (often complex) PIT systems around the world,\nCPAT, instead, obtains this information via data on the share of each\n(disposable, market) income decile’s PIT liabilities in economy-wide PIT\nliabilities. This information should already account for elements such\nas, for example, the decile-specific incidence of non-standard PIT\nregimes, informality, and tax evasion/avoidance, without the need for\nadditional assumptions in this regard.\n\nDecile-specific shares in aggregate PIT liabilities are based on nominal\nPIT liability data by decile, which is collected from two main sources.\nFirst, CPAT relies on the latest vintage(s) of the Luxembourg Income\nStudy (LIS)[^5_28]. The LIS contains nationally representative household\n(HH) survey data on income, demographics and labor market\ncharacteristics. Using the LIS, disposable income[^5_29] decile-specific,\nPIT liabilities are, thus, obtained as the HH-weighted sum of the\n“hxitax” variable[^5_30]. Second, CPAT also obtains similar data from\nthe latest vintage of the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) “Standard\nIndicators” database[^5_31] for each country. In particular, this\ndatabase contains information on the incidence (in percent of total\nmarket income) of “direct taxes” paid by market income[^5_32] decile.\nFrom this data, CPAT obtains the decile-specific sum of direct taxes\npaid. Across both data sources, decile-specific shares of income/direct\ntaxes paid are calculated as the ratios of the decile-specific total tax\nliabilities to the sum of all tax liabilities across deciles.[^5_33]\nTaking income/direct taxes as a proxy for PIT liability, the above\nresults in a database of PIT liability shares at the country-year-decile\nlevel.[^5_34] For the purposes of estimation within the CPAT 1.1.\nDistribution Module, decile-specific PIT liability shares in\neconomy-wide PIT paid are assumed to be constant over time.\n\nEconomy-wide PIT paid is, subsequently, calibrated to equal the product\nof: i) the average PIT-to-GDP ratio[^5_35] during the period\n2010-2019[^5_36]; and ii) GDP in the year of interest for the\ndistributional effects analysis, $y$.\n\nAnalytically:\n\n$L_{\\text{dcy}} = \\ s_{\\text{dc}}*{AVG\\_ PIT\\_ GDP}_{c}*\\text{RGDP}_{\\text{cy}}$\nand $l_{\\text{dcy}} = \\ L_{\\text{dcy}}/P_{\\text{dcy}}$\n\nwhere $L_{\\text{dcy}}$ and $l_{\\text{dcy}}\\ $stand for the total and\nper-capita PIT liabilities of decile $\\text{d\\ }$in country\n$\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$.\n${AVG\\_ PIT\\_ GDP}_{2010 - 2019}$ is the 2010-2019 average PIT-to-GDP\nratio for country $c$ (assumed to be constant over time),\n$\\text{RGDP}_{\\text{cy}}$ is the real GDP in constant 2021 local\ncurrency units (LCU) in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$\nand $P_{\\text{dcy}}$ is the total population of decile\n$\\text{d\\ }$in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$.\n$P_{\\text{dcy}}$ is calibrated to national population in country\n$\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$, based on the country-specific\npopulation distributions obtained from household budget surveys (HBSs)\nas part of the data requirements for the CPAT consumption incidence\ncalculations. Finally, $s_{\\text{dcy}}$ is the share of PIT liability\nof decile $\\text{d\\ }$in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year\n$y$, proxied by data on direct or individual income taxes as described\nabove.\n\nThe resulting estimates are merged with each country’s, decile-level HBS\ndata for the overall sample[^5_37], assuming a 1:1 correspondence between\nthe LIS/disposable income and CEQ/market income deciles and the\nconsumption deciles from the various HBSs. In cases, where LIS and CEQ\ncountry coverage overlaps[^5_38], CPAT prioritizes the source which\ncovers the latest available year of data[^5_39].\n\n#### Section 2: Calculations\n\nIf the user chooses to recycle a percentage of CP revenues towards\n“labor tax reductions”, the Distribution Module within CPAT 1.1\nestimates resulting per-capita decile-specific gains (in real 2021 LCU)\nunder three (mutually exclusive) PIT liability reduction scenarios:\n\n**Targeted Exemption**. Under this scenario, selected HH consumption\ndeciles gain the baseline amount of PIT they pay, conditional on\navailable CP revenues. In other words, the allocation of CP revenues\nwould be such that said deciles would not be liable for PIT. In this\ncase, the per-capita LCU gain $g$ for (HH per-capita consumption)\ndecile $\\text{d\\ }$in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$\ncan be written as:\n\n$g_{dcy\\_ TE} = l_{\\text{dcy}}\\mathbb{I\\lbrack}d = exempt\\rbrack\\mathbb{I}\\lbrack 0\\  \\leq remaining\\ CT\\ revenues\\  \\leq l_{\\text{dcy}}\\rbrack$\n\nwhere $l_{\\text{dcy}}$ stands for the per-capita PIT liability of\ndecile $\\text{d\\ }$in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$.\n$\\mathbb{I}\\left\\lbrack d = exempt \\right\\rbrack\\ $is an indicator\nfunction denoting that decile $d$ has been selected as the decile to\nbe fully exempt from PIT via the use of CP revenues.\n$\\mathbb{I}\\lbrack 0\\  \\leq remaining\\ CT\\ revenues\\  \\leq l_{\\text{dy}}\\rbrack$\nis another indicator function denoting that decile $d$ will only\nbenefit from a full PIT exemption of an amount up to (or less\nthan)$\\ l_{\\text{dcy}}$, provided that a non-zero amount of CP\nrevenues is available for said purpose. It should, thus, be noted that,\neven if CP revenues are not enough to fully offset the PIT liability of\ndecile $d$ under this scenario, the Distribution Module will still\nallocate any remaining CP revenue amounts starting from this decile (and\nmoving upwards onto any remaining deciles), provided that these amounts\nare available to be allocated.\n\n**Personal Allowance**. Under this scenario, PIT liabilities are (in\nabsolute terms) uniformly reduced across the PIT-paying population,\nsimilar to a per-capita lump-sum transfer to the working population. The\nrespective (equal, per-capita) gains are calculated by dividing the\nproportion of CP revenues used for PIT reductions by the sum of all\nindividuals in the country. The calculated amount is the maximum\navailable transfer for PIT reduction purposes. Hence, the per-capita LCU\ngain $g$ for (HH per-capita consumption) decile $\\text{d\\ }$in\ncountry $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$ can be written as:\n\n$g_{dcy\\_ PE} = {min\\{ l_{\\text{dcy}},\\ r}_{\\text{cy}}\\}$\n\nwhere $l_{\\text{dcy}}$ stands for the per-capita PIT liability of\ndecile $\\text{d\\ }$in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$.\nAdditionally, $r_{\\text{cy}}$ is the ratio of all available CT\nrevenues to the sum of all individuals in the country and represents the\nmaximum possible mean per-capita gain of a given decile $d$. Decile\n$d$ is, hence, guaranteed $l_{\\text{dcy}}$ provided that\n$l_{\\text{dcy}} < r_{\\text{cy}}\\ $. Finally, $r_{\\text{cy}}$ is\nparametrized such that it reflects use of all CP revenues made available\nfor PIT liability reductions across deciles. Specifically, any remaining\nrevenues following the aforementioned calculations are, once again,\nequally divided across all individuals in the country and paid out as\nadditional gains under this reform scenario. Since this scenario\nresembles a lump-sum, per-capita transfer to the working population,\ngains are likely to be, by default, progressively distributed. This is\nbecause transfers tend to represent a larger proportion of poorer\nhouseholds’ incomes.\n\n**Proportional Compensation**. Under this scenario, each (HH\nconsumption) decile receives an average per-capita gain that increases\nwith the HH’s baseline PIT liability. In other words, the more PIT a\ndecile pays, the higher the gain. Therefore, the per-capita LCU gain\n$g$ for (HH per-capita consumption) decile $\\text{d\\ }$in country\n$\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$ can be written as:\n\n$g_{dcy\\_ PC} = \\ l_{\\text{dcy}}*f_{\\text{cy}}$\n\nwhere $l_{\\text{dcy}}$ stands for the per-capita PIT liability of\ndecile $\\text{d\\ }$in country $\\text{c\\ }$and analysis year $y$.\nAdditionally, $f_{\\text{cy}}$ is a scalar representing the LCU gain\nfrom CP revenue recycling per LCU of baseline PIT paid. This is, in\nturn, calculated as the total LCU amount of available CP revenues\ndivided by the total LCU amount of PIT paid across all deciles. For\ninstance, a value of 0.5 would be interpreted as each HH consumption\ndecile gaining 0.5 LCUs from CP revenue recycling for each LCU of\nbaseline PIT it pays. In general (depending on the distribution and\nmagnitudes of decile-specific PIT liability shares), this scenario\nresults in a relatively more regressive effect of CP revenue recycling\nacross HH consumption deciles.\n\n#### Section 3: Assumptions and Caveats\n\nThe methodology described here is subject to a series of assumptions and\ncaveats.\n\na. The PIT liability calculations assume away any estimates based on\nactual fiscal regime data (e.g., detailed modeling of tax credits,\nsurtaxes and potential (sector-specific) deductions, etc.). More\nimportantly, no distinction is made in terms of different types of PIT\nliabilities (e.g., those for self-employed vs. non-self-employed\nworkers). Said distinction could be crucial in determining heterogeneity\nin the size and dispersion of PIT reduction gains, given that\nself-employed workers usually face a different PIT schedule.\n\nb. The PIT liability share calculations also assume that the household\nsurvey-type data available via the LIS and CEQ accurately capture the\nentirety of PIT paid across the income distribution. Ideally, PIT\nliability calculations would need to draw upon gross income and taxes\npaid as these are reported in tax return data. However, databases\ncontaining such information suffer from sparse country-year coverage and\noften lack reporting of decile-specific information.[^5_40] On a similar\nnote, the “income taxes” and “direct taxes” variables in the LIS and CEQ\ndatabases are assumed to be good proxies for the PIT, which might not be\nthe case given other potential taxes that could be captured therein\n(e.g., capital gains taxes, etc.).\n\nc. Any gains from PIT reductions are assumed to be distributed equally\nacross all population sub-groups (i.e., working and non-working\nindividuals, adults and children, men and women, etc.). This is likely\nto misstate impacts on different deciles to the extent that the\ndemographic composition of population varies substantially across\ndeciles.\n\nd. The data-generating process outlined above assumes perfect\ncorrespondence between consumption and income deciles. The individuals\nwithin HH consumption decile 1 (per the HBS data) may not be the same as\nthe ones under income decile 1 (per the LIS and CEQ data). This implies\na certain degree of inaccuracy in the use of revenue recycling gains\nfrom PIT reductions to offset specific consumer surplus losses from a\ngiven CP.\n\ne. In keeping with the static, partial equilibrium framework of the\nDistribution Module within CPAT 1.1, the revenue recycling calculations\nalso assume no changes in PIT payments/compliance in response to the CP\nscenario analyzed in CPAT 1.1. Relatedly, the calculations also abstract\nfrom trends in PIT liability patterns, since decile-specific PIT\nliability shares and PIT-to-GDP ratios are assumed constant over time.\n\nf. The calculations presented above remain agnostic as to the size and\ndistribution of PIT reduction gains for the urban vs. rural sub-samples\nin CPAT. To address this issue, CPAT scales any gains by the share of\nurban and rural population to total population, thus yielding the gains\nfor the urban and rural sub-samples respectively.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Table 5‑2<strong>: Aggregate and direct fuel consumption expenditure categories</strong></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><strong>Variable name</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Unit</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><em><strong>Auxiliary &amp; demographic variables</strong></em></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>hhid</td>\n<td>Serial number</td>\n<td>Unique household (HH) identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>iso3</td>\n<td>ISO-3 Code</td>\n<td>Country ISO-3 code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>year</td>\n<td>Year (YYYY)</td>\n<td>HH interview year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>hhsize</td>\n<td>Individuals (Count)</td>\n<td>Number of members per HH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>popw_hh</td>\n<td>Weight (Count: HHs)</td>\n<td>HH population weight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>popw</td>\n<td>Weight (Count: National Population per hhid)</td>\n<td><p>Per-capita population weight (used for binning/deciles);</p>\n<p>national population represented by each hhid.

The surveys mostly date from the period\n    2010-2019, with the exception of data for the Dominican Republic\n    (2007), Romania (1997) and Sweden (2005).\n\n[^5_31]: The CEQ “Standard Indicators” database contains data on 42 countries\n    (across all World Bank income groups), based on CEQ analyses\n    covering the period 2009-2017. See:\n    <https://commitmentoequity.org/indicators.php>\n\n[^5_32]: Similar to the LIS data described above, the CEQ database does not\n    contain data at the consumption decile level.\n\n[^5_33]: CPAT complements the LIS and CEQ data discussed here with\n    information on PIT paid by household per-capita consumption decile\n    from the household budget surveys discussed above. However, said\n    information is only available for a few countries (Egypt, Pakistan,\n    the Philippines and Ukraine).\n\n[^5_34]: Any missing country observations are replaced with the mean (or\n    median, should the user choose to report median distributional\n    effects in CPAT) of the country’s World Bank income or regional\n    (depending on what the user selects in CPAT) group. See:\n    <https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups>\n\n[^5_35]: Data on annual, country-level PIT-to-GDP ratios is obtained from the\n    IMF’s World Revenue Longitudinal Database (WoRLD). See:\n    <https://data.imf.org/?sk=77413f1d-1525-450a-a23a-47aeed40fe78>.\n\n[^5_36]: The analysis excludes countries with missing 2010-2019 average\n    PIT-to-GDP ratios. Most of these countries (e.g., the Bahamas,\n    Brunei, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates) do not have a PIT regime\n    in place.\n\n[^5_37]: Given the nature of the underlying data and calculations, it was not\n    possible to estimate PIT liabilities by type of sub-sample (e.g.,\n    urban vs. rural) and statistic (e.g., median, p25, p75). However,\n    median income/regional group averages will be used for countries\n    that lack decile-specific PIT liability shares, if CPAT users choose\n    to show median distributional effects in CPAT (for all remaining\n    countries median liabilities are assumed to equal mean liabilities).\n\n[^5_38]: This is the case for the following countries: Brazil, Colombia,\n    Dominican Republic, Peru, Russia, South Africa and the United\n    States.\n\n[^5_39]: With the exception of the Dominican Republic, CPAT prioritizes LIS\n    over CEQ, due to the former’s coverage of more recent data. LIS is\n    also preferable, owing to its inclusion of data at the disposable\n    income decile level. This is because disposable income-level data is\n    a better proxy for consumption (and, thus, welfare) relative to the\n    market income decile-level data in CEQ. By virtue of this, the LIS\n    deciles are also more comparable to the HBS deciles that CPAT uses\n    when estimating consumption incidence effects.\n\n[^5_40]: For example, see: <https://wid.world/>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc-depth":4,"output-file":"05_Distribution.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","toc-location":"left","toc-title":"***Chapter Contents***","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"05_Distribution.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
