In recent years, these twin objectives have become\nenmeshed normatively and enshrined institutionally. In the last three\nyears, 193 countries committed to achieving 17 Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs)—from tackling poverty, hunger, and gender disparities to\nimproving health, energy access, and education. In addition, 195\ncountries committed in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to\n“well below” 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Notably,\nover 130 developing countries committed to national emissions abatement\n(through Nationally Determined Contributions, NDCs), for the first time.\nAs a result, these countries need policy instruments to help them\nachieve their SDGs and NDCs.\n\nEnvironmental tax reform (ETR) has been proposed as one of the important\nparts of our toolbox to do so. ETR can help developing countries reap\nsubstantial benefits, far beyond those of climate action.\n\nMore than two decades of research in development and environmental\neconomics suggests that the welfare of ETR effects are likely to be more\npositive in developing countries than is commonly understood.\nDevelopment co-benefits, such as direct improvements in human health or\nreductions in congestion and accidents, can be very large in developing\ncountries, where air pollution kills millions and congestion reduces the\nbenefits from agglomeration externalities and urbanization. ETR can also\nhelp finance ministries raise much-needed domestic funds at lower cost\nthan some conventional sources of public revenues. These revenue gains\ncan help expanding public expenditure, building health care and social\nprotection systems, as well as investing to achieve universal access to\ninfrastructure services such as modern energy, water and sanitation,\nmobility and access to information and communication. Because ETR can be\nsimple to design and implement, low administrative capacity and\npolitical support need not hinder reform efforts.\n\nIn short, ETR can be the fiscal foundation upon which developing\ncountries achieve both the SDGs and their NDCs. With the COVID-19\ncrisis, it is widely accepted that economic stimulus and restoring sound\npublic finances are both needed, and that the recovery process can be\ndesigned to contribute to sustainable development. In particular,\ncountries with financing constraints may want to consider energy subsidy\nreforms or even explicit carbon pricing to finance urgent needs in\nhealth, social sectors or growth-enhancing tax shifts. In the second\nphase of the recovery, when fiscal consolidation will become pressing,\nfurther discussion on the potential of energy taxes is essential. In\nthis context, finance ministries can use CPAT to evaluate such reforms.\nAnother key function of the tool is to help mainstream carbon pricing\ninto WB/IMF country work. CPAT is thus aimed at economists in the World\nBank and the IMF as well as finance ministries (via the *Coalition of\nFinance Ministers for Climate Action*) and planning & line ministries.\n\nThe Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT) is a spreadsheet-based tool to\nsupport these efforts. It allows for rapid estimation of effects of\ncarbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reforms along several economic\nand non-economic dimensions. These include key macroeconomic variables,\nenergy consumption, local and global pollutants, ‘development\nco-benefits’, distribution/equity and poverty. Its objectives are to:\n\n  - Help decision-makers and analysts do quick diagnostics on the\n    potential benefits from explicit carbon pricing and fossil fuel\n    subsidy reforms to inform SCDs and other country strategies;\n\n  - Provide first estimates of benefits across different dimensions\n    (from tax revenues to health) to start an engagement with country\n    counterpart and identify areas where more in-depth analyses are\n    needed or promising.\n\nFor instance, CPAT is used for the EFI EU Regular Economic Report, which\ninforms the EU’s consideration of environmental fiscal reforms; Mexico’s\nPublic Finance Review, which examines its carbon tax; reviews of\nhealth-related tax reform option for Brazil and China (with Health GP);\nIvory Coast’s PMR program; CGE and macrostructural models for Pakistan,\nItaly, Vietnam (within the MTI macro-modelling team); and for TA to\nNorthern Macedonia's on environmental tax reform review (ETR). CPAT can\ncontribute to various reports products within the WB (SCDs, CPFs, DPOs,\nCEMs, State & Trends). CPAT has e.g. formed the analytical basis for a\nBank-Fund\n[report](https://www.financeministersforclimate.org/sites/cape/files/inline-files/IMF-WB%20Coalition%20Note%20-%20Implications%20of%20the%20Global%20Economic%20Crisis%20for%20Carbon%20Pricing.pdf)\nto the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action on carbon\npricing.\n\nCPAT is being developed jointly by the World Bank and IMF. It evolved\nfrom an earlier IMF tool, described in Appendix III of a 2019 Board\nPaper “[Fiscal Policies for Paris Climate\nStrategies](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2019/05/01/Fiscal-Policies-for-Paris-Climate-Strategies-from-Principle-to-Practice-46826)”\nand further applied in the IMF’s [October 2019 Fiscal\nMonitor](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/2019/09/12/fiscal-monitor-october-2019)\non “How to Mitigate Climate Change”. Background research for the various\nchannels modeled has been completed by the CPAT team, notably through\nthe studies “[Benefits beyond\nClimate](https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/10.1596/978-1-4648-1358-0_ch1)”\nand “[Getting Energy Prices\nRight](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF071/21171-9781484388570/21171-9781484388570/21171-9781484388570.xml?language=en&redirect=true)”.\n\n## CPAT dashboard and outputs \n\nThe CPAT tool is primarily a dashboard. It allows the user to input\nchoices regarding the policy under investigation (such as a carbon tax\ntrajectory, with different options for exemptions and recycling of the\nrevenues) and modeling choices (e.g., choice between different data\nsources). The tool produces a series of assessment and visualization of\nthe impact of the policy scenarios on several dimensions including:\n\n  - mitigation and energy efficiency (i.e., the reduction in GHG\n    emissions, changes in energy consumption);\n\n  - macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates (GDP, tax revenues);\n\n  - air pollution and health (concentration, but also mortality and\n    morbidity);\n\n  - transport (road fatalities and congestion);\n\n  - distributional impacts (per consumption decile, but also by\n    (urban/rural) sub-sample, and industrial cost changes)\n\nA schematic view of the tool is provided in Figure 2‑1, and a screenshot\nof the dashboard is provided in Figure 2‑2. It is expected that the tool\nis used to explore various policy options, either in an interactive way,\nor to create country-specific document.\n\nThe tool is calibrated on 150 countries, but the user is advised to\nremain cognizant of data issues, which can affect the quality of the\nassessment. The Distribution module is more limited, as it depends on\nthe specific treatment of household surveys. This module is currently\navailable for 64 countries, but additional countries will be\ncontinuously added over time.\n\n![](./02/media/image1.png)\n\nFigure 2‑1. Summary of the CPAT v1.0 structure\n\n![](./02/media/image2.png)\n\nFigure 2‑2. Illustration of the CPAT1.0 Dashboard (partial view, see the\nexcel file for the full dashboard)\n\n## CPAT structure and methodology \n\nThis section provides a summary of the methodology (or methodologies)\nused by each of the modules, as well as basic comparison with\nstate-of-the-art models. The value of CPAT is to be consistent with\nthese state-of-the-art models in each dimension, and to provide *in one\nplace all these dimensions together to facilitate analysis and\ncomparisons and help teams prepare country diagnostics*. For the\ninterested reader, in-depth methodological notes are available for each\nmodule ([CPAT chapters documentation\nhere](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/Epo8kZyrIi9GpLusNG8A-IsBfbDJJCzfzIBVinzJ18vgRQ?e=fQmqQb)).\n\n### Mitigation module\n\nThe mitigation module is a simplified reduced-form model of fuel\nconsumption, deriving quantities under a baseline and a policy scenario\nbroadly in line with more complex models (the IEA's World Energy Model,\nEnerdata POLES). The mitigation module's primary goal is to predict\nenergy use, energy prices, emissions, carbon tax revenues, and GDP\neffects over the time horizon of CPAT (2019-2035). More details are\navailable below in the methodological notes.\n\nThe module takes four types of inputs: (1) energy balances and price\ninputs; (2) external forecasts (baseline international energy prices and\nmacro indicators); (3) parameter inputs (elasticities, fiscal\nmultipliers); (4) user-specified policy inputs (for example, the level\nand coverage of a carbon tax, exemptions phase-out and other inputs).\n\nThe module's outputs include energy consumption by fuel type and sector,\ngreenhouse gas emissions (CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG such as leaked\nmethane), fiscal revenues and GDP effects, price changes, power\ngeneration, and power sector investment.\n\nThe mitigation module forms the core of CPAT: when the user chooses a\npolicy in the dashboard, the mitigation module works out the direct\nimpact of the policy, displays it in the dashboard, and passes the\noutputs on to other modules (see Figure 2‑1).\n\nThe general approach to determining baseline fuel consumption and the\nresponse to a carbon tax or other policy is a simplified, reduced-form\nmodel based on income and price elasticities. The changes in energy\nconsumption from the base year are driven by energy prices (including\nthe influence of mitigation policy) and real (total) GDP. Real GDP\nadjusts to changes in fiscal policy through multiplier effects. It can\nbe considered the main driver of the baseline, while energy prices are\nthe primary driver of any policy, such as a carbon tax. Exogenous\nchanges to efficiency and the price of renewable energy are also drivers\nof fuel use and consumption.\n\nFor data and parameter sources, see the mitigation chapter. For example,\nelasticities with regard to prices and income are derived from Burke and\nCsereklyei (2016)[^2_1] using the relationship from Gertler and others\n(2016).[^2_2]\n\nThe mitigation module includes two power sector models, an\n'elasticity-based' model and a hybrid techno-economic dynamic model\n(‘engineer model’) of the power sector with explicit capital stock.\nThe two models use the same power demand elasticities and separately\nconsider power generation's costs by type. The user can either select\n‘average’ – meaning an average of both models – or tailor the model\nusing the engineer model alone\n\nThe 'elasticity-based' model uses marginal increases in fuel prices and\nprice elasticities to determine the shares of each generation type. It\nis simple, transparently parameterized, easily explainable, and easily\ndeployable in an Excel spreadsheet model used in previous versions of\nCPAT and IMF tools.\n\nThe techno-economic ‘engineer’ model explicitly models the capacity of\ndifferent generation types, with capacity[^2_3] expanding to meet desired\npower demand. Flexible capacity (gas and coal) is allocated according to\nmarginal price, with a sigmoidal function of relative price. Investment\nis also a function of levelized cost, with a system penalty for the cost\nof integrating high levels of renewable penetration. Transmission losses\nare modeled as a fixed quantity of total generation.\n\nThe main advantage of the engineer model' is that it allows modeling\ndecisions changing the stock of assets in the power sector (investment\nand retirement) and decisions changing the use of assets for power\ngeneration (dispatch). In addition, the model allows the user to define\na Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) scale up rate. The rates reflect a\n‘linear’ type constraint. It constrains generation in VRE additions to\nbe a certain percentage of total generation (in gross additions, not net\nof retirements). The model is consistent with countries' generation\ncapacities and makes it possible to investigate the radically different\npower systems consistent with high carbon prices, while the empirical\n'elasticity-based' model is valid only for more marginal changes.\n\nFinally, as one of the main outputs, the mitigation module estimates\ncarbon pricing effects on GDP. CPAT adjusts the baseline GDP growth\nforecasts endogenously depending on different carbon pricing and revenue\nrecycling scenarios. The module captures two channels: the fiscal\neffects and the impact on consumption. In the first channel, a carbon\ntax has both direct and indirect effects on GDP. The latter arises when\nthe carbon tax revenues are recycled as a reduction of other taxes\nand/or increased government spending. We quantify these effects using\nthe CPAT fiscal multipliers estimates. In the second channel, the change\nin GDP affects energy consumption and, therefore, the effective carbon\ntax revenues. This channel is captured by the income elasticities of\nenergy demand.\n\nCPAT uses four sources of fiscal multipliers: “Income-group” multipliers\nand “global” averages are obtained from the World Bank’s Macro-Fiscal\nModel (MFMod). “Estimated” multipliers are obtained econometrically from\npanels of high- and low-income countries created along the dimensions of\nincome levels, regions, debt levels and trade openness. Country-specific\nmultipliers are then obtained as weighted averages over the respective\nmultipliers from each sample/subsample which the country is part of.\nFinally, since multipliers tend to be higher during expansions and lower\nduring contractions, all baseline multipliers can be adjusted upwards\nand downwards by adding/subtracting one empirical standard deviation.\nThis takes into account the uncertainty around empirical estimates and\ngives the CPAT user additional flexibility in choosing the appropriate\nset of multipliers. Finally, the user has the option to “manually” enter\nthe preferred multipliers, thereby allowing for a thorough exploration\nof the uncertainty in these parameters.\n\nA full summary for reviewers including a list of change and full\ninformation about the validation of the mitigation module against ex\npost studies and other models, is available in the mitigation chapter of\nthis report. See section 3.9.\n\n### Air Pollution module\n\nPolicies aimed to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon pricing, can lead\nto a reduction in ambient air pollution due to the co-emission of GHGs\nand local pollutants when burning fossil fuels. Local pollutants, such\nas BC, OC, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and NMVOC are responsible for\nthe formation of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone\n(O<sub>3</sub>) pollution. These pollutants contributed to 6.67 million\ndeaths and 213 million DALYs in 2019 ([Institute for Health Metrics and\nEvaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/results/gbd_summaries/2019/air-pollution-level-2-risk)).\nAir quality improvements will reduce mortality and morbidity and CPAT\nquantifies those effects as a co-benefits of carbon pricing.\n\nThe air pollution module is mostly based on models developed by external\ninstitutions and researchers, but also includes modeling developed\nspecifically for CPAT. The main inputs are: (1) energy consumption in\ntime and scenario by fuel type and sector from the Mitigation module;\n(2) emissions factors net of projected average use of pollution control\nequipment, fuel processing and combustion method from GAINS model[^2_4];\n(3) concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone for the baseline year\n(2019); (4) emissions-to-concentrations relationships for ambient PM2.5\nand ozone, based on source receptor matrices (TM5-FASST), regression\nanalysis, source apportionment studies, intake fractions and machine\nlearning models, (5) relative risk functions for exposure to\nPM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>; and (7) population projections in\ntime. Details are available in the [air pollution methodological\nnote](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/ESNJcNab4fJNv67rvBCkzUsBUh2kDVJrdehXBrWopD2T0w?e=W3MHHe).\n\nThe main results from the air pollution module are mortality and\ndisability adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributed to air pollution\n(ambient and household) under the baseline and the carbon price\nscenario. Other outputs include the economic valuation of averted deaths\n(using a transferred value of the statistical life), health expenditure,\nworking days lost due to pollution and market output losses due to\nmorbidity and mortality.\n\nReduced-form approximations are used to estimate emissions,\nconcentration of pollutants and health effects. We use and adapt the\nresults of more complex models into simplified relationships. For\ninstance, in the case of the relationship between emissions of\npollutants and ambient concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and ozone,\nCPAT includes the option to use the results from a linear emulator of a\ncomplex global chemical transport model. The results of the air\npollution module are in line with other more complex models (see Figures\n2-5 and 2-6), although both CPAT and the models to which we compare to\nare subject to uncertainty and the results may be sensitive to the\nassumptions used. We address this issue in CPAT by allowing the user to\ninput local information, if available, and to switch among\nmethodological options (with the best options possibly dependent on the\ncountry chosen).\n\n<span class=\"chart\">$CHART$</span>\n\nFigure 2‑3.

With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to sharp\nincreases in inequality and poverty, distributional concerns have become\nmore relevant to decision-makers. In the realm of environmental fiscal\nreforms, equity and poverty considerations receive even more political\nattention than in the context of ‘traditional’ fiscal reforms. Public\nacceptability is strongly driven by the reforms’ perceived fairness and\nimpact on low-income households.\n\nThe Distribution Module of CPAT 1.0 aims to inform the spread of the\nimmediate fiscal incidence *across* (vertical distribution) and *within*\n(horizontal distribution; see Figure 2-7) income groups, focusing on\nconsumption effects and compensatory schemes. Tax-induced consumer price\nchanges and revenue recycling in the form of direct transfers have been\nat the center of the literature on fiscal redistribution, since such\nsalient, short-term effects are arguably the most relevant from a\npolitical economy perspective.[^2_6] More details are available in the\n[Distribution methodological\nnote](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA6356749-C825-4812-856A-D8F078D42407%7D&file=5.%20Distribution.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)\n(with [detailed country\ncoverage](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3A1F6C13-3DA8-4816-9490-C9EC4444A530%7D&file=Coarse%20Distribution%20Module%20Coverage.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)).\n\n![](./02/media/image3.png)\n\nFigure 2‑5. Net distributional effect with cash transfer: Horizontal\ndistribution of relative consumption effects (% consumption for $50\nCarbon tax per tCO2e in 2022), China\n\nThe Distribution Module allows the user to estimate the carbon tax\nincidence on consumption, taking into account the direct effect from the\nuse of fuels, as well as the indirect effect from the consumption of\nother, non-fuel/-energy goods and services. We follow the standard\napproach in the literature, combining household budget survey (HBS)\ninformation with input-output (IO) data, adjusted such that they yield\nthe same effective carbon price revenues as the ones produced by the\nMitigation Module. Country-fuel-sector- price increases are based on\nscenario-specific estimates from CPAT’s Mitigation Module. Further, the\nuser is provided with two options to relax the typical IO assumptions of\nfull cost-push impacts and absence of behavioral adjustments.\nAdditionally, there is one option to rebate the price increases of a\ncountry’s primary cooking fossil fuel to selected bottom deciles to help\nprevent them from switching to biomass.\n\nFour modes of <span class=\"underline\">direct and indirect transfer\nschemes</span> can be simulated, once the user inputs the share of\nrevenues allocated under each scheme type: i) new or existing targeted\ntransfers (for which the user can decide the targeted percentiles, among\nother features); ii) transfers towards public investment in\ninfrastructure access; and iii) scaling up an existing social protection\nscheme (following the targeting of the initial scheme), and iv)\nreforming countries’ personal income tax (PIT) schemes. The revenue\namounts available for redistribution are based on scenario-specific\nestimates from the Mitigation Module. New or existing targeted transfers\nare universal among the targeted percentiles, while infrastructure\ntransfers are targeted to those households without initial access to\nclean water, affordable electricity, clean sanitation, Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICT), or public transport, based on HBS\nmicrodata. Revenue recycling that increases current public spending is\nproportional to the existing social protection schemes, such as social\nassistance, insurance, or in-kind benefit schemes. Further to the above,\ntransfer scheme targeting is also available for decile-specific\npopulation shares that are below international poverty lines (incomes of\n1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day) via “poverty-conditional cash transfers”.\n\nBoth negative consumption effects as well as positive compensation\nscheme effects are expressed as shares of pre-reform consumption and in\nabsolute, per-capita monetary terms on a decile level, separately for\nthe rural, urban and overall (or national) populations.[^2_7] For\nvertical distribution graphs, the user can further choose between decile\nmean and median consumption data inputs. Horizontal distribution between\nthe 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of consumption data\ninputs within each decile is available for consumption effects (both\nabsent as well as net of compensation schemes).\n\n![](./02/media/image4.png)![](./02/media/image6.png)\n\n### Road Transport module\n\nCarbon pricing impacts fuel prices and shapes driving behavior and can\nthereby contribute to internalizing externalities from driving.\nIncreases in fuel prices predictably lead to reductions in vehicle-miles\ntraveled (VMT). This may be a result of people transitioning to other\ntransport modes, e.g. public/collective transport options, choice of\nresidence and workplace location or behavioral changes including\ncar-pooling, trip frequencies and driving behavior (aggressive vs.\nfuel-efficient acceleration). As road traffic has many externalities\naside carbon emissions, the reduction in VMT also leads to a reduction\nin transport-related externalities such as congestion, accidents and\nroad damage. To estimate the magnitude of these co-benefits, the road\ntransport module quantifies the effect of a user-defined carbon price or\nroad fuel tax on (1) the intensity of congestion as measured by the time\nlost relative to free-flowing traffic, (2) the number of road\nfatalities, and (3) the maintenance cost due to road damage.\n\nThe Road Transport module is based on elasticities that we estimate\nusing an international country-year level dataset. This dataset is\ncompiled from many sources and describes road transport, as well as\ngeneral demographics and economic variables. The dataset covers the time\nfrom 1994 to 2019 and 180 countries, so that we can use within-country\nand between-country variation for identification. We estimate\nelasticities with respect to fuel prices and with respect to fuel taxes,\nas well as short and long-run elasticities. Our country-specific\nelasticities are based on global coefficients and country-specific\ncovariates.\n\n![](./02/media/image7.png)\n\nFigure 2‑8. Input and output of CPAT’s Road Transport module\n\nThe magnitude of the resulting elasticities are broadly in line with the\nliterature: for a 10% fuel price increase from a carbon tax, total\nvehicle-km traveled decrease in the short run on average by 3.5%;\ncongestion levels decrease by 4.5%; accident fatalities decrease by\n2.9%; and road damage by decreases by 2.0% in the long run.\n\nThe estimated elasticities are used within CPAT to produce policy\nforecasts of total vehicle-km traveled, congestion levels, accident\nfatalities and road damage cost. By choosing a country and using\ndifferent parameters for a policy in the dashboard, the user obtains a\nseries of graphs showing the time series with and without the policy, as\nwell as the policy impact given by the difference of the two time\nseries.\n\n[^2_1]:  Burke, Paul J., and Zsuzsanna Csereklyei. 2016. “Understanding the\n    Energy-GDP Elasticity: A Sectoral Approach.” Energy Economics 58:\n    199–210. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.07.004.\n\n[^2_2]:  Gertler, Paul J., Orie Shelef, Catherine D.
