# Distribution Module


## Introduction

Income inequality, poverty and, more generally, social justice
considerations are increasingly becoming a centerpiece of governments’
fiscal policy decisions. With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to sharp
increases in inequality and poverty, distributional considerations have
become even more relevant to decision-makers. In the realm of
environmental fiscal reforms, equity and poverty concerns often receive
more political attention than in the context of ‘traditional’ fiscal
reforms. Public acceptance is strongly driven by reforms’ perceived
fairness and impact on low-income households.[^5_1]

The Distribution Module of CPAT1.0 aims to inform the spread of the
immediate fiscal incidence *across* (vertical distribution) and *within*
(horizontal distribution) income groups, focusing on consumption effects
and compensatory schemes. Tax-induced consumer price changes and revenue
recycling in the form of direct transfers have been at the center of the
literature on fiscal distribution, since such salient, short-term
effects are arguably the most relevant from a political economy
perspective.[^5_2]

The Distribution Module allows the user to estimate the
<span class="underline">carbon tax incidence on consumption</span>,
taking into account the direct effect from the use of fuels, as well as
the indirect effect from the consumption of other, non-fuel/-energy
goods and services. We follow the standard approach in the literature,
combining household budget survey (HBS) information with input-output
(IO) data, adjusted such that they yield the same effective carbon price
revenues as the ones produced by the Mitigation Module.[^5_3]
Country-fuel-sector- price increases are based on scenario-specific
estimates from CPAT’s Mitigation Module. Further, the user is provided
with two options to relax the typical IO assumptions of full cost-push
impacts and absence of behavioral adjustments. Additionally, there is
one option to rebate the price increases of a country’s primary cooking
fossil fuel to selected bottom deciles to help prevent them from
switching to biomass. Results from the Distribution Module have been
cross-checked and verified against peer-reviewed country case studies
(c.f. Table VI-4 in the Appendix).[^5_4]

Four modes of <span class="underline">direct and indirect transfer
schemes</span> can be simulated, once the user inputs the share of
revenues allocated under each scheme type: i) new or existing targeted
transfers (for which the user can decide the targeted percentiles, among
other features); ii) transfers towards public investment in
infrastructure access; and iii) scaling up an existing social protection
scheme (following the targeting of the initial scheme)), and iv)
reforming countries’ personal income tax (PIT) schemes. The revenue
amounts available for redistribution are based on scenario-specific
estimates from the Mitigation Module. New or existing targeted transfers
are universal among the targeted percentiles, while infrastructure
transfers are targeted to those households without initial access to
clean water, affordable electricity, clean sanitation, Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT), or public transport, based on HBS
microdata. Revenue recycling that increases current public spending is
proportional to the existing social protection schemes, such as social
assistance, insurance, or in-kind benefit schemes. Further to the above,
transfer scheme targeting is also available for decile-specific
population shares that are below international poverty lines (incomes of
1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day) via “poverty-conditional cash transfers”.

Both negative consumption effects as well as positive compensation
scheme effects are expressed as shares of pre-reform consumption and in
absolute, per-capita monetary terms on a decile level, separately for
the rural, urban, and overall (or national) populations.[^5_5] For
vertical distribution graphs, the user can further choose between decile
mean and median consumption data inputs. Horizontal distribution between
the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of consumption data
inputs within each decile is available for consumption effects (both
absent as well as net of compensation schemes).

### Summary: Distribution Module Overview

#### Problem definition and approach

Both taxation and spending policies may aim to redistribute in a way
that post-tax income equality is ameliorated relative to pre-tax income
equality, often with a special emphasis on the poorest segments of the
population. Thus, the progressivity or regressivity (that is, the
vertical incidence of fiscal policy options across income groups) are
policy-relevant considerations. In addition, horizontal distribution
(i.e., distribution within the same income group) has gained increasing
attention, as the within-income-group spread of the incidence (expressed
as a share of consumption) has been found to be potentially larger than
the spread of incidence across income groups due to heterogeneous
socioeconomic conditions.[^5_6] Horizontal distributional policy analysis
is of particular interest with respect to political economy as well as
poverty considerations. Identifying the parts of the population which
will benefit/pay the most, relative to their income, is crucial to
designing and evaluating any tax or social assistance scheme.

We measure distributional effects of both tax incidence and revenue
recycling in a narrow monetary sense, proxied by relative changes in
consumption. Our estimates overstate the negative taxation effects,
while understating the positive effects of climate change mitigation and
compensation measures. Specifically, the tax incidence analysis focuses
on the consumption channel, disregarding structural effects on wages and
overall employment, which may positively outweigh consumption-side
effects, as they tend to be positive, larger and progressive.[^5_7] In
addition, we disregard the large health co-benefits from improved air
and environmental quality as well as reduced traffic accidents, road
damage and congestion (please, refer to Technical Appendices of Air
Pollution and Transport Modules for further details).

CPAT’s proposed compensation schemes can facilitate the reduction of
more fundamental inequalities, due to their economic co-benefits of
improved health, education, and opportunity. in this sense, proxying
compensation scheme benefits to households by using their monetary
amounts is an underestimate of said benefits. For example, sustained
conditional cash transfer programs to poorer households can
significantly improve child health and educational outcomes and, thus,
promote the formation of human capital.[^5_8] Unconditional cash
transfers to the ultra-poor can accelerate the energy transition to
cleaner fuels and reduce energy poverty.[^5_9] Increasing the quality and
quantity of and access to infrastructure has been found to significantly
reduce income inequality, poverty and to accelerate growth.[^5_10]
Furthermore, scaled-up social protection measures and access to clean
sanitation or clean energy can have similar positive, long-term effects
regarding development and human capital outcomes. Finally, improving PIT
progressivity has been associated with lower levels of income
inequality.[^5_11]

#### Functionalities

CPAT’s Distribution Module enables *ex-ante* analyses necessary for
informed decision making with respect to how equitable and pro-poor
environmental fiscal reform packages would be across countries. As there
is no “one-size-fits-all” fiscal reform, the user can choose between
several policy design options, particularly with respect to
distributional implications within and across household income groups.

The Distribution Module includes the following features:

**Tax incidence:**

  - Consumption effect (from direct and indirect energy consumption)

  - Adjustments to consumption effect:
    
      - Mitigation-adjusted tax incidence (“behavioral and structural
        change”)
    
      - “Emissions-based adjustment of product price changes” (implied
        revenues on households from IO data consistent with calculated
        revenues in Mitigation Module)
    
      - Reduced cost pass-through (of energy price increases)
    
      - Behavioral adjustments, considering consumption decile-specific
        price elasticities of demand
    
      - Special tax rebate for poor households: exemption of cooking
        fuels

**Compensatory scheme incidence:**

  - Various transfer schemes:
    
      - Targeted transfers (new or existing social protection scheme(s))
    
      - Public investment (in infrastructure access spending – e.g.,
        toward SDGs, proxied as cash

  - Current (non-targeted) spending (e.g., scaling up existing social
    protection scheme(s))Choice of receiving income percentiles and
    precision of targeting under “Targeted transfers”

  - Cash transfers to people below poverty line: targeting of
    decile-specific population that is below international poverty lines
    (incomes of 1.9 or 3.2 2011 PPP USD/day)

  - Reduction in PIT liabilities

**Socioeconomic heterogeneity**: results using median/mean HBS
decile-level data, across overall, rural and urban (sub-)samples,
horizontal/vertical distribution of effects, consumption effects absent
(and net of) compensation schemes Some features may not be available for
all countries covered, due to data-related availability constraints. The
Distribution sheet in CPAT lists the countries available in the Module.

Distribution Module, includes a Codebook, supplementary Guidebook, as
well as two coding templates (in STATA format) containing data
harmonization, preparation and cleaning processes.

## Household budget survey preparation

**Estimations of the distribution of carbon tax burdens as well as
revenue recycling scheme benefits are largely based on microdata in the
form of national household budget surveys (HBSs). This section describes
how the primary household-level data are harmonized and aggregated
before they are incorporated into CPAT.**

### Household budget shares

$\pi^{\text{dg}}$is the budget share of expenditures on a given,
category g item by a household in decile d. It represents the
consumption as observed in a survey year in a specific country.
Household consumption shares are processed from HBSs, which are
country-specific and heterogenous in terms of structure and coverage.
Where possible, CPAT aims to incorporate the latest HBS of the country.
This section describes how these shares are calculated.

First $C_{j}^{g}$, household j’s annual consumption on expenditure
category g, is estimated from HBSs. There are two types of expenditure
categories: i) direct fuel/energy consumption expenditures: electricity,
natural gas, gasoline, diesel, coal, oil/lubricants, LPG, kerosene,
charcoal, ethanol and firewood (listed in Figure 5‑1) and ii) non-direct
fuel/energy consumption expenditure[^5_12]: appliances, chemicals,
clothing, communications, education, food, health services, housing,
paper, pharmaceuticals and medicine, recreation and tourism,
transportation equipment, public transportation, and other expenditures
(Table 5‑2). Expenditure items in household surveys are mapped to these
CPAT expenditure categories[^5_13] and aggregated to create household
consumption under said categories.

In addition to budget shares, CPAT captures households’ poverty status
with respect to the PPP USD 2011 1.9 and 3.2 daily poverty lines. Dummy
variables indicate position with respect to the poverty line(s) based on
households’ per capita total consumption including actual (not imputed)
rent. Poverty incidence is then summed by decile and informs
poverty-conditional cash transfers CPAT.

Subsequently, household budget shares $\pi_{j}^{g}\ $ are calculated
for each household *j* from by dividing each household’s consumption of
each expenditure category *g* by total household consumption
($C_{j}$). Total consumption (for the purposes of budget share
estimation) is the sum of consumption in all expenditure categories g,
where the category “housing” (see Table VI-3) does not include imputed
rent of a dwelling.[^5_14]

$\pi_{j}^{g} = \frac{C_{j}^{g}}{C_{j}} = \ \frac{C_{j}^{g}}{\sum_{}^{}C_{j}^{g}}\ $

(1)

Household budget shares $\pi_{j}^{g}\ $are aggregated at the household
per-capita consumption decile to arrive at $\pi_{}^{\text{dg}}$.
Household per-capita consumption-based decile generation (as well as any
associated percentile statistics) are weighed by the corresponding
survey per-capita population weights (*popw*) to ensure sample
representativeness at the national level. Household per-capita
consumption ($cons\_ pc)$ for the purposes of decile generation is
total household consumption including imputed rent (*tot\_cons*) divided
by household size (*hhsize*): $cons\_ pc = tot\_ cons/hhsize$.
Following the literature, CPAT, thus, proxies lifetime income, or
standard of living, with consumption expenditures, as they are widely
considered a better proxy for welfare than nominal (e.g., wage)
income.[^5_15]

$\pi_{}^{\text{dg}}$ is estimated for the overall (i.e., national)
sample of households as well as separately for urban and rural
households. In addition to average household budget shares, the median,
25<sup>th</sup> percentile, and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile statistics
are generated for all three samples (overall, urban and rural) at the
decile level.

*Outlier treatment*: Any non-missing consumption shares that lie above
three (3) standard deviations (SD) of their corresponding
(popw-weighted) means in each specific expenditure category are treated
as outliers. The outliers are replaced, by decile, with the decile’s
popw-weighted mean household consumption share in the specific
expenditure category.

*Decile sensitivity check*: Household per-capita consumption deciles are
based on total household consumption, including imputed rent. The
sensitivity of these deciles is checked against the number of households
shifting deciles when total household consumption is defined as
excluding any rent (*tot\_cons\_norent in 1*).

### Household infrastructure access

In addition to household budget shares, indicators for household access
to infrastructure are generated and used within CPAT.
$\digamma_{}^{\text{di}}$ is the weighted share of households (in
percent) within decile d which have access to infrastructure category
*i*. These categories are access to i) water; ii) electricity; iii)
sanitation; iv) ICT; and v) public transportation (listed and defined in
Table 5‑3 under “infrastructure access”).

First, $\digamma_{j}^{i}$, a binary variable taking the value of 1 if
a household has access to infrastructure category I (0 otherwise), is
generated for each household j in the HBS. Next,
$\digamma_{}^{\text{di}}$, the popw-weighted average share of
$\digamma_{j}^{i}$ , is calculated for each decile. Note that, since
weights are per capita weights, infrastructure access shares represent
individuals (not households). Shares are calculated for the overall,
urban, and rural sub-samples.

## Microsimulation Method

CPAT’s Distribution Module enables *ex-ante* analysis of distributional
effects of user-defined environmental fiscal reform packages, focusing
on consumption effects and compensatory schemes (see Figure 5‑1 for an
overview). Section 5.3.1 outlines the carbon tax incidence analysis,
section 5.3.2 presents further options with regard to tax incidence
estimates; section 5.4 introduces the estimation of compensatory
schemes, including transfers and reductions in PIT liabilities.

![](./05/media/image1.png)

Figure 5‑1: Overview of the deployed microsimulation approach and
respective functionalities. Note: for the first step (calculating direct
and indirect energy consumption), please refer to section 5.2 Household
data preparation.

### Tax incidence analysis

CPAT assesses the consumption incidence of carbon fiscal policies across
different income groups by means of a microsimulation model. Consumption
effects are measured as the costs of maintaining pre-reform consumption
(i.e., households’ additional expenditures), observed from country-level
HBS data, with the user-defined carbon tax scenario in place. Thus, this
microsimulation focuses on the short-term consumption changes in terms
of compensating variation, assuming fixed consumption patterns. In other
words, households are assumed not to adjust their behavior in response
to the carbon price, and consumption effects represent upper-bound
estimates (Dorband et al 2019). Estimating price and income elasticities
of demand, differentiated across countries, income levels and
energy/non-energy products is a data- and resource-intensive task, which
can be partly integrated into the analysis via a user option to apply
decile-specific price elasticities of demand (based on USDA data[^5_16])
to said microsimulation estimates (see also Section 4.3.2).

The **consumer incidence of an energy-based upstream carbon tax** is
determined by the tax-induced price changes of fossil fuels, as well as
by the direct and indirect energy consumption bundles of households;
that is, by households’ direct fuel combustion or use of electricity,
and the indirect consumption of energy embedded in other goods and
services. Thus, the proportion of additional expenditures *P* of
individual *j* after the policy intervention is a multiplicative
function of (i) average energy intensities $\overline{e_{\text{fg}}}$
(USD/USD) of fuel *f* of consumption items from each sector *g (note
that f* ∈ *g*); (ii) total expenditures $C$*;* and (iii) the tax rate
*t for fuel f in sector g, expressed as the price increase post- (p2)
relative to pre-reform (p1)* (USD<sub>p2</sub>/USD<sub>p1</sub>) (c.f.
endnote 3).

$p_{j} = \ \sum_{\text{fg}}^{}{p_{\text{fgj}}\  = \ }\frac{\sum_{\text{fg}}^{}{\overline{e_{\text{fg}}}\ *t_{\text{fg}}*\ C_{\text{gj}}}}{C_{j}}$
, *f* ∈ *g*

*(* *2)*

The **tax-induced price changes of fossil fuels** (c.f. Table 5‑1 for a
list of fuels), which determine households’ additional expenditures on
direct fuel consumption (for f=g, in Eq. ( 3)), are a function of fuels’
carbon intensities, $e_{f}$, measured by emissions factors, and
pre-existing price distortions in the Mitigation Module. For each
user-defined carbon fiscal scenario, price changes are obtained from the
Mitigation Module (see respective Mitigation Module Documentation). As
price increases vary for each fuel by sector (due to varying emissions
factors and baseline pricing), price changes are estimated for each
country, year and fuel-sector pair $t_{\text{fg}}$, where “sectors”
here are power, industry, and residential. Residential sector fuel price
changes are used to calculate the direct consumption effects.

The **tax-induced price changes of goods and services based on the
domestic carbon price**, which determine households’ additional
expenditures on indirect fuel consumption (for *f* ∉ *g*, in Eq. ( 4)),
follow a standard input-output (IO) approach. Consistent with much of
the carbon tax literature, all price increases resulting from the
user-defined carbon fiscal reform are expected to be fully passed
forward, from producers and suppliers to final consumers. Estimated
consumer price increases are, thus, absolute upper bounds.[^5_17] Adapted
from basic IO analyses (cf. Leontief, 1986; Minx et al., 2009),
household energy intensities $\overline{e_{g}}$ result as entries of
the vector:

$e_{g} = f\left( I - A \right)^{- 1}$, *f* ∉ g

( 4)

where each fossil fuel sector, *f* is a vector assigning an energy
intensity coefficient to each non-fuel sector. The
$\left( I - A \right)^{- 1}\ $matrix, or Leontief inverse (cf.
Leontief, 1986), accounts for all upstream inputs that are required to
produce one unit of final demand for each sector. $I$ is the identity
matrix and $\text{A\ }$is a normalized matrix of technical
coefficients based on inter-sectoral commodity flows.

For **(IO) data**, we use the Global Trade Analysis Project
(GTAP-10)[^5_18] to compute fossil fuel/energy intensities, and
respective price changes for non-fuel sectors. The GTAP-10 database has
several advantages. First, it is a consistent global database which
harmonizes and scales data for 65 disaggregated sectors (g) and 141
world regions to the year 2014. Such harmonized data improve
comparability across country-specific results in CPAT. Important for the
estimation of sectoral effects from country-fuel-sector price changes is
that GTAP-10 provides a more granular disaggregation of energy sectors
than other global IO data with similar regional coverage (e.g., EORA).
Yet, while CPAT distinguishes between eight fossil fuel/energy carriers,
GTAP-10 includes only five fossil fuel sectors and electricity (c.f.
Table 5‑1). Based on the concordance table, for GTAP’s “Petroleum and
coke products” (p\_c) sector, CPAT calculates the weighted average price
change, using the economy-wide fuel use volumes of these products (in
ktoe from IEA 2020) as weights.

Table 5‑1: Concordance table of CPAT fossil fuels (with acronyms) to
GTAP-10 fossil fuel sectors

| **CPAT fossil fuel (f)** | **GTAP10 sector (f)** |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Coal (coa)               | coa                   |
| Electricity (ely)        | ely                   |
| Natural gas (nga)        | gas/gdt               |
| Other oil products (oop) | oil                   |
| Gasoline (gso)           | p\_c                  |
| Diesel (die)             |                       |
| LPG (lpg)                |                       |
| Kerosene (ker)           |                       |

Finally, sectoral energy intensities, $e_{g}$, and household
expenditures, $C_{\text{gj}}$, are produced for 14 indirect fuel
consumption categories. Household consumption is computed as described
in section 5.2 from primary HBS data. Individual consumer items reported
in the surveys are mapped to the respective GTAP sectors, which, in
turn, are mapped to the 14 consumption categories (c.f. Table 5‑1 for
concordance between categories and sectors). Thus, all of the 59
non-energy GTAP sectors, which produce end-consumer goods and services,
are aggregated into 14 average product categories. Groupings are
determined on the grounds of comparable average levels of
energy-intensity, as well as to match IEA sectoral definitions used in
CPAT. For a complete concordance table among relevant sources of data,
please, refer to CPAT’s ‘Mapping’ tab. Thus, for each GTAP fuel sector,
*f*, energy intensities, $e_{g}$ in Eq. ( 4), of the 14 CPAT
consumption categories, g, are a weighted average of the energy
intensities of the respective non-fuel GTAP sectors, weighted by GTAP’s
household final demand vector, *Y*.

The CPAT Distribution Module is an improvement over the **standard
approach in the literature**. CPAT explicitly models a domestic carbon
price reform. This means, Leontiefs between fossil fuels and sectors of
production reflect only the domestically burned fuels. ‘Embedded’ fuel
inputs in imports are not considered in the carbon price-induced price
change of goods and services. Particularly in countries with high shares
of imports in the goods and services consumed domestically, this
approach may yield lower, but more accurate, results on consumption
incidence.

### Optional features for tax incidence analysis

#### Mitigation-adjusted tax incidence

The Module provides the user with an option to roughly assess how the
consumption effects would decrease if emissions reductions induced by
the carbon price reform were taken into account. This adjustment scales
down overall consumer price increases relative to the scheme’s
mitigation effect, thus relaxing the cost-push assumption. The
Mitigation Module provides estimates of economy-wide GHG emissions
reductions and tax revenues from carbon taxation over time. As noted
above, the sectorally more disaggregated Distribution Module is based on
IO Leontief production functions. This assumes fixed technical
coefficients and, thus, full price pass-through, such that the estimated
tax incidence is to be understood as an absolute upper bound, or
short-term, estimate. CPAT provides the user with an approximate measure
of the extent to which consumption effects would decrease if behavioral
responses and structural change were accounted for: for the (future)
year of interest, CPAT compares the tax revenue estimates of the
elasticities-driven Mitigation Module with the tax revenues of the
IO-based Distribution Module[^5_19], i.e. the proportion of revenues
raised after and before taking into account behavioral responses:

Let the economy-wide tax burden, or total tax revenues, estimated in the
Mitigation Module be $P_{M}^{y}$ for year y, and in the Distribution
Module be $P_{D}^{y}$ ($P_{M}^{y} < \ P_{D}^{y}\ $), where:

$P_{D} = \ \sum_{j}^{}{p_{j}*C_{j}}$

( 5)

represents the total revenues expected based on representative HBS
consumption data C<sub>j</sub>. As survey data aggregates usually do not
match national accounts, and as total revenues should compare for the
year of interest in the simulation, CPAT scales $P_{D}$ to match the
national accounts in the year of interest y (2022 $\leq$ y $\leq$
2030), such that:

$P_{D}^{y} = \ P_{D}*\ \frac{\text{GDP}^{y}*\theta_{c}}{\sum_{}^{}C_{j}}$

( 6)

where GDP<sup>y</sup> represents the expected GDP in the year of
interest in the simulation and $\theta_{c}$ represents the final
consumption expenditure to GDP ratio for the latest available year from
World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database.[^5_20] Then,
the downward adjustment factor to the tax incidence on consumers,
$p_{\text{Adj}}$ follows as:

$p_{\text{Adj}} = \ \frac{P_{D}^{y} - P_{M}^{y}}{P_{D}^{y}}$ ,
$P_{M}^{y} < \ P_{D}^{y}$

( 7)

The adjustment factor $p_{\text{Adj}}$ is applied homogenously across
the population, represented as a positive relative consumption effect in
CPAT. This approach will be refined in subsequent versions of CPAT:
estimating with more precision the distributional effects of relaxing
the assumption of full pass-through of tax-induced price changes to the
end-consumer requires sophisticated data on production- and
consumption-side energy price elasticities. Within countries, households
of different income strata consume different product bundles (as
discussed in the extensive literature on Engel Curves). Thus, for a
thorough distributional analysis one needs to determine: a) how price
elasticities vary across sectors/products; and b) how price elasticities
of demand for products vary with income.

#### Decile-specific price elasticities of demand

CPAT allows the user to model short-term adjustments on the demand side
alone, using decile-, country-, and item-specific price elasticities of
demand based on (Muhammad et al., 2011). The price elasticities provided
are by country and consumption category (COICOP), as well as for high,
middle and low income countries. Based on standard concordance tables
(ISIC Rev. 4 and CPC 2.1), CPAT maps the elasticities to CPAT
consumption categories. CPAT, then, adopts the countries’ elasticity
reported for the middle deciles and assumes that the upper and lower
deciles’ elasticities will deviate from the elasticity reported by the
same proportion as the elasticities for low- and high-income countries
deviate from that of middle-income countries for each consumption item.
Following the same approach as in the Mitigation Module, the
country-decile-specific price elasticity of demand for consumption
category g, ${\epsilon_{\text{use}}}^{g}$ is changing $C_{j}^{g}$ as
follows:

$C_{j}^{g}*\left( \frac{p_{t}}{p_{t - 1}} \right)^{\epsilon_{\text{use}}}$

( 8)

#### Imperfect pass-through

CPAT also provides the user with the option to allow producers to
absorb, i.e. not “pass through”, part of the tax-induced price increase.
There is ample evidence that (irrespective of any fuel saving/switching
behavior) firms pass forward only a portion of the tax-induced energy
price increase.[^5_21] The Distribution Module differentiates
pass-through coefficients for 14 transport and industrial sectors, with
coefficients ranging from 0.7 to 0.9, and averaging 0.8. Coefficients
$\gamma_{g}\ $($\gamma_{g} \leq 1)$ are applied to the tax rate *t
for sector g, expressed as the price increase post- relative to
pre-reform*[^5_22]*, such that the downward-adjusted energy price change*
${\ t}_{\text{fg}}^{*}$ *can be expressed as:*

${\ t}_{\text{fg}}^{*} = t_{\text{fg}}*\gamma_{g}$

( 9)

#### Emissions-based adjustment of sectoral price changes

As described above, the incidence of goods’ and services’ price changes
on consumers is based on GTAP-related fuel-sector Leontiefs. Multiplying
the Leontief with the respective fuel’s price change, we obtain
‘indirect’ consumer price changes (in the static option). This
multiplication implicitly introduces a price assumption to the GTAP
monetary flow of energy: based on observed fuel prices (USD/volume or
weight of fuel in 2021), the Mitigation Module estimates expected fuel
price changes. Thus, this calculation assumes a corresponding energy
flow. However, this energy flow might not necessarily match the observed
energy flow by fuel and sector (which CPAT takes from IEA Energy
Balances). To correct for this potential imbalance, CPAT allows the user
to adjust consumer price incidence by theoretical time-zero revenue
flows from the carbon pricing reform modelled. This means that, using
the best available empirical data (IEA Energy Balances, GAINS emissions
factors, and IMF combined fuel price data), CPAT calculates the revenues
that would be raised if no price-induced adjustments were to take place
– hence the term time-zero revenues. These theoretical revenue streams
are calculated by fuel and CPAT sector. The final demand portion of this
price incidence on the economy (usually around 60%, as the remainder is
accounted for by goods which are exported or consumed by government and
fixed capital formation) is equivalent to the static consumption
incidence which should be reflected in the analysis. CPAT, thus, allows
the user to scale the baseline incidence to this level. If chosen,
additional adjustments are, then, calculated using this new baseline.

#### Cooking-fuel adjusted tax incidence

For selected deciles (starting from the poorest one), CPAT provides the
user with the option to exclude from taxation the fossil fuel which is
used as a primary cooking fuel. The rationale is as follows: when taxing
primary cooking fuels (e.g., LPG), there may be a risk of households
being pushed into using traditional, unsustainable biomass (e.g.,
firewood or charcoal). Therefore, the user can model distributional
effects of carbon taxes when households in the bottom (e.g., one or two)
deciles do not face an increase in the price of their primary cooking
fossil fuel. From a policy design standpoint, this option is to be
understood as a rebate. That is, the household will pay the tax when
buying the fuel but will receive a compensatory transfer for its cooking
needs. Such rebate schemes have received particular attention during
India’s LPG subsidy reform, which implemented the Direct Benefit
Transfer Scheme for LPG (“Pratyaksha Hastaantarit Laabh (PAHAL)”)
program.[^5_23]

Primary cooking fossil fuels are identified for each country based on
the World Health Organization (WHO) Household Energy Database[^5_24].
Covering 161 countries, the database collects and harmonizes household
survey data on the portion of the population cooking with each of
fourteen disaggregated fuels, considering surveys between 1970-2014. For
each country, and the latest available year of survey data, CPAT
determines which of the eight fossil fuels listed in Table 5‑1 is most
widely used for cooking.

## Incidence of compensatory transfers

Given countries’ heterogeneous development status, and political and
socioeconomic realities, the design of environmental fiscal reforms
varies widely. CPAT provides the user with various options for recycling
revenues from environmental fiscal policy scenarios, including via
direct and indirect support schemes. Direct transfer schemes to
households provide a particularly suitable instrument for increasing
public acceptance of tax reforms. This is because they are salient,
immediate, and well-targetable. Additionally, direct transfer programs
are widely adopted globally, as they have proven to be an effective
means of achieving key development goals, with some of them being more
administratively simple to implement, due to digitization.

In CPAT, the user can choose among three general options for
redistribution via transfers to households. All three redistribution
options are modelled as direct, per capita payments averaged by deciles:

1.  Decile-targeted transfers (new or existing social protection
    scheme(s))

2.  Public investment (in infrastructure access)

3.  Current spending (e.g., scaling up existing social protection
    scheme(s))

4.  Labor tax reforms (as personal income tax reforms)

### Targeted and infrastructure-based transfers

Beyond the choice among (*a)-c)* above), the following four parameters
are user-defined:

1.  the percentage share of total revenues to be used for (new,
    existing) targeted and/or public spending transfers;

2.  (for new/existing targeted transfers only) the per capita income
    percentiles to receive the chosen transfer (starting from the bottom
    of the income distribution; C<sub>jT</sub> $\leq \ $p(T)
    C<sub>j,</sub>);

3.  (for new/existing targeted transfers only) the “coverage rate”, i.e.
    the share of the population targeted actually receiving the
    transfer; and

4.  (for new/existing targeted transfers only) the “leakage rate”, i.e.
    the share of the untargeted population receiving the transfer.

Options 3. and 4. allow the user to consider imperfect implementation of
cash transfer schemes, such that parts of the population which would
qualify for the transfer do not receive it, while other parts of the
population (not qualifying) do so, due to imperfect targeting. Such
leakage is assumed to be spread equally across the non-targeted
population.

The amount of the targeted, per capita transfer, T, for the targeted
population, pop<sub>T</sub>, is calculated by dividing total transferred
revenues by the total eligible or ‘targeted’ population in the year of
interest y, such that:

$T_{}^{y} = \frac{P_{M}^{y}}{\text{pop}_{T}^{y}}$

( 10)

Where the survey population (i.e., the sum of per capita population
weights)[^5_25] is scaled to match the projected national accounts,
*pop*, based on the IMF’s 2022 World Economic Outlook vintage, for the
year of interest, such that:

$\text{pop}_{T}^{y} = {(\sum_{}^{}\text{popw}}_{T})*\ \theta_{\text{pop}}^{y}\ $

( 11)

where

$\theta_{\text{pop}}^{y} = \ \frac{\text{pop}^{y}}{\sum_{}^{}\text{popw}}$

( 12)

**New targeted transfers** are conditional on per capita consumption
(user-choice 2. above). Thus, the average per capita transfer,
$T_{d\ }^{y}$, for decile d depends on the portion of the decile
population, $\text{pop}_{T}^{\text{dy}}$ , below the targeted
consumption threshold (i.e. for which C<sub>jT</sub> $\leq \ $p(T)
C<sub>j</sub>) such that:

$T_{d\ }^{y} = \ T_{}^{y}*\frac{\sum_{}^{}\text{pop}_{T}^{\text{dy}}}{\sum_{}^{}\text{pop}_{}^{\text{dy}}}$

( 13)

**Transfers toward infrastructure access** are received only by those
individuals without initial access to infrastructure type i,
$\digamma_{j}^{i}$ (refer to section 5.2 for details). The user can
choose between five different types of infrastructure provision: CPAT
defines infrastructure access in line with the WHO’s WASH database[^5_26]
and WB WDI database indicators as follows:

1.  Access to improved water source: piped water on premises (piped
    household water connection located inside the user’s dwelling, plot
    or yard), other improved drinking water sources public taps or
    standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected
    springs, and rainwater collection

2.  Access to improved sanitation facilities: flush/pour flush (to piped
    sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine), ventilated improved pit
    (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet

3.  Access to electricity: household connection to
    local/village/national grid/network; not: battery, generator, PV
    system

4.  Access to information & communication technology (ICT): ownership of
    mobile phone/computer, household internet access

5.  Access to public transport

The portion of the decile population, $\text{pop}_{T}^{\text{dy}}$,
receiving the transfer, as per Equation ( 13) is calculated based on the
weighted share of households in decile d who have access to
infrastructure category *i,* $\digamma_{}^{\text{di}}$, such that

$\text{pop}_{\text{Ti}}^{\text{dy}} = \ \sum_{d = 1}^{10}\text{pop}_{}^{\text{dy}}*(1 - \digamma_{}^{\text{di}})$

( 14)

### Transfers through existing social protection schemes

Policy makers may favor extending existing social safety nets for the
transfer of carbon tax revenues to households. CPAT, thus, provides the
option to proportionally scale up existing social protection schemes,
based on the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and
Equity (ASPIRE) dataset. For 104 countries, ASPIRE provides
quintile-level estimates of per capita transfers received through
various benefit schemes, including social assistance measures such as
targeted subsidies, in-kind assistance and existing cash transfer
programs, labor market protection schemes as well as social insurance
(please, refer to the ASPIRE documentation for a full catalog of covered
schemes by country[^5_27]).

As CPAT simulates a proportional scaling of existing schemes, it first
determines the proportion $\mathrm{\Delta}A\ $by which the protection
scheme *a* can be scaled up. Following equation ( 10) above, CPAT
defines:

${\mathrm{\Delta}A}_{a}^{y} = \frac{P_{M}^{y}}{A_{a}^{y}}$

( 15)

where $A_{a}^{y}$ is the inflation-adjusted total government spending
on protection scheme *a* in the year of interest y. For calculating
total government spending, CPAT first multiplies per capita quintile
transfer amounts by a fifth of the population pop<sub>y</sub> in the
year of interest y, to arrive at total spending by quintile, which is,
then, summed up. CPAT arrives at average decile transfers assuming that
every two deciles receive the same amount (in per capita terms) as their
corresponding quintile (e.g., deciles 1 and 2 receive the per-capita
transfer of quintile 1 and so on). The approach described here (in
tandem with options 1-4 listed under Section 5.4.1 above) also applies
when users choose to recycle carbon tax revenues via existing (as
opposed to new) targeted transfers.

### Carbon Price Revenue Recycling via Personal Income Tax Reductions

#### Section 1: Data Requirements and Setup

The distributional effects of carbon price (CP) revenue recycling via
personal income tax (PIT) reductions depend on the baseline PIT
liabilities of individuals at different segments of the income
distribution. Broadly speaking, these liabilities are a function of two
components: taxable (i.e., “gross”) income and PIT schedules. To
circumvent the modeling of (often complex) PIT systems around the world,
CPAT, instead, obtains this information via data on the share of each
(disposable, market) income decile’s PIT liabilities in economy-wide PIT
liabilities. This information should already account for elements such
as, for example, the decile-specific incidence of non-standard PIT
regimes, informality, and tax evasion/avoidance, without the need for
additional assumptions in this regard.

Decile-specific shares in aggregate PIT liabilities are based on nominal
PIT liability data by decile, which is collected from two main sources.
First, CPAT relies on the latest vintage(s) of the Luxembourg Income
Study (LIS)[^5_28]. The LIS contains nationally representative household
(HH) survey data on income, demographics and labor market
characteristics. Using the LIS, disposable income[^5_29] decile-specific,
PIT liabilities are, thus, obtained as the HH-weighted sum of the
“hxitax” variable[^5_30]. Second, CPAT also obtains similar data from
the latest vintage of the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) “Standard
Indicators” database[^5_31] for each country. In particular, this
database contains information on the incidence (in percent of total
market income) of “direct taxes” paid by market income[^5_32] decile.
From this data, CPAT obtains the decile-specific sum of direct taxes
paid. Across both data sources, decile-specific shares of income/direct
taxes paid are calculated as the ratios of the decile-specific total tax
liabilities to the sum of all tax liabilities across deciles.[^5_33]
Taking income/direct taxes as a proxy for PIT liability, the above
results in a database of PIT liability shares at the country-year-decile
level.[^5_34] For the purposes of estimation within the CPAT 1.1.
Distribution Module, decile-specific PIT liability shares in
economy-wide PIT paid are assumed to be constant over time.

Economy-wide PIT paid is, subsequently, calibrated to equal the product
of: i) the average PIT-to-GDP ratio[^5_35] during the period
2010-2019[^5_36]; and ii) GDP in the year of interest for the
distributional effects analysis, $y$.

Analytically:

$L_{\text{dcy}} = \ s_{\text{dc}}*{AVG\_ PIT\_ GDP}_{c}*\text{RGDP}_{\text{cy}}$
and $l_{\text{dcy}} = \ L_{\text{dcy}}/P_{\text{dcy}}$

where $L_{\text{dcy}}$ and $l_{\text{dcy}}\ $stand for the total and
per-capita PIT liabilities of decile $\text{d\ }$in country
$\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$.
${AVG\_ PIT\_ GDP}_{2010 - 2019}$ is the 2010-2019 average PIT-to-GDP
ratio for country $c$ (assumed to be constant over time),
$\text{RGDP}_{\text{cy}}$ is the real GDP in constant 2021 local
currency units (LCU) in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$
and $P_{\text{dcy}}$ is the total population of decile
$\text{d\ }$in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$.
$P_{\text{dcy}}$ is calibrated to national population in country
$\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$, based on the country-specific
population distributions obtained from household budget surveys (HBSs)
as part of the data requirements for the CPAT consumption incidence
calculations. Finally, $s_{\text{dcy}}$ is the share of PIT liability
of decile $\text{d\ }$in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year
$y$, proxied by data on direct or individual income taxes as described
above.

The resulting estimates are merged with each country’s, decile-level HBS
data for the overall sample[^5_37], assuming a 1:1 correspondence between
the LIS/disposable income and CEQ/market income deciles and the
consumption deciles from the various HBSs. In cases, where LIS and CEQ
country coverage overlaps[^5_38], CPAT prioritizes the source which
covers the latest available year of data[^5_39].

#### Section 2: Calculations

If the user chooses to recycle a percentage of CP revenues towards
“labor tax reductions”, the Distribution Module within CPAT 1.1
estimates resulting per-capita decile-specific gains (in real 2021 LCU)
under three (mutually exclusive) PIT liability reduction scenarios:

**Targeted Exemption**. Under this scenario, selected HH consumption
deciles gain the baseline amount of PIT they pay, conditional on
available CP revenues. In other words, the allocation of CP revenues
would be such that said deciles would not be liable for PIT. In this
case, the per-capita LCU gain $g$ for (HH per-capita consumption)
decile $\text{d\ }$in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$
can be written as:

$g_{dcy\_ TE} = l_{\text{dcy}}\mathbb{I\lbrack}d = exempt\rbrack\mathbb{I}\lbrack 0\  \leq remaining\ CT\ revenues\  \leq l_{\text{dcy}}\rbrack$

where $l_{\text{dcy}}$ stands for the per-capita PIT liability of
decile $\text{d\ }$in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$.
$\mathbb{I}\left\lbrack d = exempt \right\rbrack\ $is an indicator
function denoting that decile $d$ has been selected as the decile to
be fully exempt from PIT via the use of CP revenues.
$\mathbb{I}\lbrack 0\  \leq remaining\ CT\ revenues\  \leq l_{\text{dy}}\rbrack$
is another indicator function denoting that decile $d$ will only
benefit from a full PIT exemption of an amount up to (or less
than)$\ l_{\text{dcy}}$, provided that a non-zero amount of CP
revenues is available for said purpose. It should, thus, be noted that,
even if CP revenues are not enough to fully offset the PIT liability of
decile $d$ under this scenario, the Distribution Module will still
allocate any remaining CP revenue amounts starting from this decile (and
moving upwards onto any remaining deciles), provided that these amounts
are available to be allocated.

**Personal Allowance**. Under this scenario, PIT liabilities are (in
absolute terms) uniformly reduced across the PIT-paying population,
similar to a per-capita lump-sum transfer to the working population. The
respective (equal, per-capita) gains are calculated by dividing the
proportion of CP revenues used for PIT reductions by the sum of all
individuals in the country. The calculated amount is the maximum
available transfer for PIT reduction purposes. Hence, the per-capita LCU
gain $g$ for (HH per-capita consumption) decile $\text{d\ }$in
country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$ can be written as:

$g_{dcy\_ PE} = {min\{ l_{\text{dcy}},\ r}_{\text{cy}}\}$

where $l_{\text{dcy}}$ stands for the per-capita PIT liability of
decile $\text{d\ }$in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$.
Additionally, $r_{\text{cy}}$ is the ratio of all available CT
revenues to the sum of all individuals in the country and represents the
maximum possible mean per-capita gain of a given decile $d$. Decile
$d$ is, hence, guaranteed $l_{\text{dcy}}$ provided that
$l_{\text{dcy}} < r_{\text{cy}}\ $. Finally, $r_{\text{cy}}$ is
parametrized such that it reflects use of all CP revenues made available
for PIT liability reductions across deciles. Specifically, any remaining
revenues following the aforementioned calculations are, once again,
equally divided across all individuals in the country and paid out as
additional gains under this reform scenario. Since this scenario
resembles a lump-sum, per-capita transfer to the working population,
gains are likely to be, by default, progressively distributed. This is
because transfers tend to represent a larger proportion of poorer
households’ incomes.

**Proportional Compensation**. Under this scenario, each (HH
consumption) decile receives an average per-capita gain that increases
with the HH’s baseline PIT liability. In other words, the more PIT a
decile pays, the higher the gain. Therefore, the per-capita LCU gain
$g$ for (HH per-capita consumption) decile $\text{d\ }$in country
$\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$ can be written as:

$g_{dcy\_ PC} = \ l_{\text{dcy}}*f_{\text{cy}}$

where $l_{\text{dcy}}$ stands for the per-capita PIT liability of
decile $\text{d\ }$in country $\text{c\ }$and analysis year $y$.
Additionally, $f_{\text{cy}}$ is a scalar representing the LCU gain
from CP revenue recycling per LCU of baseline PIT paid. This is, in
turn, calculated as the total LCU amount of available CP revenues
divided by the total LCU amount of PIT paid across all deciles. For
instance, a value of 0.5 would be interpreted as each HH consumption
decile gaining 0.5 LCUs from CP revenue recycling for each LCU of
baseline PIT it pays. In general (depending on the distribution and
magnitudes of decile-specific PIT liability shares), this scenario
results in a relatively more regressive effect of CP revenue recycling
across HH consumption deciles.

#### Section 3: Assumptions and Caveats

The methodology described here is subject to a series of assumptions and
caveats.

a. The PIT liability calculations assume away any estimates based on
actual fiscal regime data (e.g., detailed modeling of tax credits,
surtaxes and potential (sector-specific) deductions, etc.). More
importantly, no distinction is made in terms of different types of PIT
liabilities (e.g., those for self-employed vs. non-self-employed
workers). Said distinction could be crucial in determining heterogeneity
in the size and dispersion of PIT reduction gains, given that
self-employed workers usually face a different PIT schedule.

b. The PIT liability share calculations also assume that the household
survey-type data available via the LIS and CEQ accurately capture the
entirety of PIT paid across the income distribution. Ideally, PIT
liability calculations would need to draw upon gross income and taxes
paid as these are reported in tax return data. However, databases
containing such information suffer from sparse country-year coverage and
often lack reporting of decile-specific information.[^5_40] On a similar
note, the “income taxes” and “direct taxes” variables in the LIS and CEQ
databases are assumed to be good proxies for the PIT, which might not be
the case given other potential taxes that could be captured therein
(e.g., capital gains taxes, etc.).

c. Any gains from PIT reductions are assumed to be distributed equally
across all population sub-groups (i.e., working and non-working
individuals, adults and children, men and women, etc.). This is likely
to misstate impacts on different deciles to the extent that the
demographic composition of population varies substantially across
deciles.

d. The data-generating process outlined above assumes perfect
correspondence between consumption and income deciles. The individuals
within HH consumption decile 1 (per the HBS data) may not be the same as
the ones under income decile 1 (per the LIS and CEQ data). This implies
a certain degree of inaccuracy in the use of revenue recycling gains
from PIT reductions to offset specific consumer surplus losses from a
given CP.

e. In keeping with the static, partial equilibrium framework of the
Distribution Module within CPAT 1.1, the revenue recycling calculations
also assume no changes in PIT payments/compliance in response to the CP
scenario analyzed in CPAT 1.1. Relatedly, the calculations also abstract
from trends in PIT liability patterns, since decile-specific PIT
liability shares and PIT-to-GDP ratios are assumed constant over time.

f. The calculations presented above remain agnostic as to the size and
distribution of PIT reduction gains for the urban vs. rural sub-samples
in CPAT. To address this issue, CPAT scales any gains by the share of
urban and rural population to total population, thus yielding the gains
for the urban and rural sub-samples respectively.

    pass-through assumption was relaxed. The approach is explained in
    Section 5.3.2 and will be refined in subsequent versions of CPAT.

[^5_29]: The LIS does not, generally, collect consumption information, making
    it difficult to obtain income taxes paid by household (weighted)
    per-capita consumption decile.

[^5_30]: This variable contains annual “income taxes” paid by households in
    the survey year and is available for 26 countries (across all World
    Bank income groups). The surveys mostly date from the period
    2010-2019, with the exception of data for the Dominican Republic
    (2007), Romania (1997) and Sweden (2005).

[^5_31]: The CEQ “Standard Indicators” database contains data on 42 countries
    (across all World Bank income groups), based on CEQ analyses
    covering the period 2009-2017. See:
    <https://commitmentoequity.org/indicators.php>

[^5_32]: Similar to the LIS data described above, the CEQ database does not
    contain data at the consumption decile level.

[^5_33]: CPAT complements the LIS and CEQ data discussed here with
    information on PIT paid by household per-capita consumption decile
    from the household budget surveys discussed above. However, said
    information is only available for a few countries (Egypt, Pakistan,
    the Philippines and Ukraine).

[^5_34]: Any missing country observations are replaced with the mean (or
    median, should the user choose to report median distributional
    effects in CPAT) of the country’s World Bank income or regional
    (depending on what the user selects in CPAT) group. See:
    <https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups>

[^5_35]: Data on annual, country-level PIT-to-GDP ratios is obtained from the
    IMF’s World Revenue Longitudinal Database (WoRLD). See:
    <https://data.imf.org/?sk=77413f1d-1525-450a-a23a-47aeed40fe78>.

[^5_36]: The analysis excludes countries with missing 2010-2019 average
    PIT-to-GDP ratios. Most of these countries (e.g., the Bahamas,
    Brunei, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates) do not have a PIT regime
    in place.

[^5_37]: Given the nature of the underlying data and calculations, it was not
    possible to estimate PIT liabilities by type of sub-sample (e.g.,
    urban vs. rural) and statistic (e.g., median, p25, p75). However,
    median income/regional group averages will be used for countries
    that lack decile-specific PIT liability shares, if CPAT users choose
    to show median distributional effects in CPAT (for all remaining
    countries median liabilities are assumed to equal mean liabilities).

[^5_38]: This is the case for the following countries: Brazil, Colombia,
    Dominican Republic, Peru, Russia, South Africa and the United
    States.

[^5_39]: With the exception of the Dominican Republic, CPAT prioritizes LIS
    over CEQ, due to the former’s coverage of more recent data. LIS is
    also preferable, owing to its inclusion of data at the disposable
    income decile level. This is because disposable income-level data is
    a better proxy for consumption (and, thus, welfare) relative to the
    market income decile-level data in CEQ. By virtue of this, the LIS
    deciles are also more comparable to the HBS deciles that CPAT uses
    when estimating consumption incidence effects.
