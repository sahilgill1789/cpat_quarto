## What climate policies can be assessed using CPAT?

### Carbon Pricing Policies

The table below summarizes the climate policies options available in
CPAT. The first column displayed the number corresponding to the policy
in CPAT Excel-sheet. The carbon tax, ETS, feebate and energy efficiency
regulations are qualified general policies as they cover all sectors.
Nevertheless, exemptions can be applied for individual fuels and sectors
(with the option to phase out exemptions over time). Other policies are
sector- or fuel-specific.

| **Number**                           | **Policy coverage**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 2                                    | Carbon tax                         | This policy represents a carbon tax applied to the supply of all fossil fuels in proportion to their carbon content. It is modeled by adding to the pre-existing tax on a particular fuel a charge equal to the product of the CO2 emissions factor for that fuel and the tax rate on CO2.                                                                                                            |
| 3                                    | ETS                                | These policies are modeled in a similar way to a tax (CPAT is deterministic and does not capture uncertainty over emissions prices associated with ETSs). That is, CPAT requires the user to estimate the likely price of an ETS and then impose that to find the emissions reduction.[^1_1]                                                                                                           |
| 4                                    | Feebates                           | Feebates provide a revenue-neutral, sliding scale of fees on activities (like power generation) or products (like vehicles). Activities or products with above average emission rates pay a net tax; activities or products with below average emission rates get net revenues.                                                                                                                       |
| 5                                    | Energy efficiency regulations      | These policies reduce the emissions or energy intensity of a sector but without the same demand response (e.g., reductions in VKT) as under carbon pricing because they do not involve the pass through of carbon tax revenues (or allowance rents) in higher prices (e.g., for electricity or gasoline) – they also produce a partially offsetting increase in emissions through the rebound effect. |
| **Fuel or sector-specific policies** |                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reform Policies.

In addition to these policies, CPAT allows the user to phase out fossil
fuel subsidies and reform regulated prices. See the relevant sections
below.

### Power Sector Policies

The power sector model contains policies that adjust the cost of
capital, adjust Power Purchase Agreements etc. See the relevant sections
below.

## Quick Start Guide: Climate Policy Assessment Tool (CPAT)

**Welcome to CPAT\!** This guide aims to show you how to use CPAT, give
you an idea of some common issues, and indicate CPAT’s data needs.
Supplementary material and technical documentation can be found
[here](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/EtxrNY3Un19HvoA8ySfj5XwBeb2FCK8kR2O_d8zwTZRjYQ?e=CdykwP).

**What is CPAT?** CPAT is a tool for analyzing the impacts of carbon
pricing and fossil fuel reforms along several economic and non-economic
dimensions.

**Opening CPAT:** CPAT is a spreadsheet-based tool. You need Excel 2016
or later. Since CPAT is a relatively large spreadsheet, please close
other apps. Please ensure ‘Automatic Calculations’ are turned **on**
(File \> Options \> Formulas).

![](./01/media/image1.png)

Figure 1‑1: Automatic calculations

**Navigating CPAT:** Please, navigate first to the **Dashboard** tab.

![](./01/media/image2.png)

Figure 1‑2: Navigation CPAT

### Input: Country and Proposed Policy Trajectory

**Policy Input Area:** At the top left, you see various input cells. The
yellow cells are user-editable. Categorical cells can be altered by
clicking the small down arrow. By clicking on the cell which currently
shows Carbon tax, you can select a different carbon pricing policy
(e.g., an ETS), which comes with sectoral exemptions pre-set. All
policies are defined by the carbon price. The carbon price trajectory is
defined by the introduction date (here 2022), the start level (here
$50/tCO<sub>2</sub>), the target level of the carbon price (here
$75/tCO<sub>2</sub>), and the year that this target level will be met
(here 2030).

Figure 1‑3: Country and policy input area

**Carbon Price Trajectory:** To check that your suggested carbon tax is
in place, please see the policy strength graph under *Key inputs and
outputs*. On default settings, the policy is extended linearly beyond
the end date. The dotted lines in the left-hand graph show the
recommended range for a carbon price recommended by the High-level
Commission on Carbon Pricing. The right-hand graph shows the policy’s
coverage, including any exemptions (see later for defining exemptions)

### Output: Emissions, Revenues, and Co-Benefits

The main outputs are shown under *Key inputs and outputs* in *Panel B*.
From the left, these graphs show:

![](./01/media/image5.png)

Figure 1‑5: Key inputs and outputs

1.  GHG emissions relative to baseline (dashed line) & NDC target
    (dotted horizontal line)

2.  Fiscal revenues (before recycling of funds)

3.  Impact on projected GDP growth

4.  Impacts on households (note: only countries for which household data
    are available)

5.  Co-benefits: averted air pollution & road accident deaths

6.  Total monetized benefits from the policy

### Sense-Checking

The CPAT team is constantly working to keep CPAT up to date, but CPAT is
not bulletproof. You should run a few sense-checks as described below.
Some of these checks relate to the reliability of input data. Many CPAT
users can access national data sources. For continuous improvement of
the tool, we would very much appreciate it if such data sources could be
shared with us in case data is either missing or substantively different
from what is currently in CPAT.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Check 1: Start by ensuring that the graphs show and update when you change carbon price inputs** (i.e., there should be no errors in panel B: all graphs should show except, for some countries, the fourth graph on the impact on households). |

**Defaults for parameters:** Click the + button for advanced settings.

![](./01/media/image6.png)

Figure 1‑6: The '+' button

This expandable panel contains a wide range of parameter settings and
adjustments.

**Default parameters are indicated with an asterisk** (e.g., ‘Base\*’).
Suppose you change a parameter away from its default setting. In that
case, the color changes from yellow to orange. An indicator at the
bottom of the ‘Miscellaneous’ section indicates the number of parameters
that have departed from default values.

|                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Check 2: Check how many defaults are different from expected. For default use, the line at the bottom of the Miscellaneous row should be blank/invisible.** |

| **Example of all settings set to default values** | **Example of two settings NOT set to default values** |

*Figure* *1‑7: Example of settings (default vs. no default)*

### Exemptions 

One can exempt any fuels and sectors from the carbon tax (if unticked).
So, if, e.g., Kerosene and Cement are unticked, all Kerosene is exempted
(independent of the sector), and all Cement energy use is exempt
(independent of fuel).

|                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Check 3: Ensure that all checkboxes are ticked for full policy coverage (recommended) or unticked as desired.** |

### Phase-out exemptions, subsidies, and revenue recycling

On the right-hand side at the top of the dashboard, the user can change
settings relating to the phase-out of exemptions, price controls, and
subsidies. It also includes supplementing the policy with renewable
energy subsidies and the use of revenues. For revenue recycling, there
are five options: labor tax reductions, corporate tax reductions, public
investment, current spending, and compensatory transfers to households.

### NDC data

CPAT includes data on countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) under the UNFCCC. The ‘NDCs’ Tab summarizes the NDC baseline data
for your country. As countries may be updating their NDCs, please check
online in the [UNFCCC NDC
Registry](https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/Pages/Home.aspx) if
the information shown is up to date, and in line with the latest
submitted version. If not, please, copy the table, fill it out, and send
to the team.

### Prices

*Panel A* under the *Mitigation module (macro & energy effects)*
includes a table showing average fuel prices and tax-induced percentage
changes. Price changes depend on carbon content as well as pre-existing
price distortions (e.g., subsidies).

Note that a significant increase in the price of coal is expected in
many countries, even under a moderate carbon tax. For example, $80/t
carbon tax with a coal emission factor at \~0.1 tCO<sub>2</sub>/GJ would
correspond to $8/GJ carbon tax. If baseline (subsidized) coal prices
were $2/GJ with the subsidy around $0.5/GJ, prices would increase 400%,
even without subsidies phase-out. A more moderate situation is shown in
the table to the right for Poland, where we see the price of coal
increase by 164.8%.

**Prices data form:** if the user believes they have better prices data,
they can choose to use ‘manual’ prices in calculations and fill the
‘manual inputs’ tab in CPAT. Also we recommend filling and sending
[this

to the CPAT team so we can update the global CPAT version accordingly.

| **Check 6: Are prices and percentage changes reasonable?** |

### Distributional consumption effects on households

For distributional results, first, [check if household data for your
country is already included in CPAT](\\l); if *not*, process your
microdata following the [Codebook and
scripts](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dheine_worldbank_org/EkSiwIBBzxdGh7jePslDsUMBy-f_rMWlAFgC05Ag1wQ0vQ?e=igAOH2)
(3-4 days’ resource commitment); if *yes*, define how to transfer
revenues (drop-down menu under ‘Policy options’); adjust accordingly if
red flags appear. If ‘No’ adjustment for behavioral/structural change is
selected, the price increases are fully passed on to the consumer, which
may overestimate consumption effects (i.e., the tax-induced mitigation
effect is not considered). Alternatively, choose to factor in
decile-specific, price-driven demand adjustments/elasticities.

Choose whether distributional effects are expressed based on
decile-specific mean or median consumption data: While *median* effects
are more representative, some fuels may not be shown if \> 50% of
households report zero or missing expenses (e.g., due to poor data
quality). We recommend that effects not be modeled further than five
years out.

### Contribution of sources to ambient particulate matter 

Does the contribution by sector look reasonable? A “reasonable number”
should be above 20% and below 90% for most countries. The sectorial
distribution could be compared to country level information, if
available. If the contribution does not look appropriate when comparing
with local information available, the user can change the modeling
approach.

Figure 1‑13: Air pollution settings and sources of ambient particulate
matter

The option “Manual-FASST” will allow the user to input their own
information, in “Manual inputs tab”. In this case, the user would need
to input the contribution of each sector to ambient PM2.5. The
recommended default option is “Avg. iF and LS FASST”, which uses the
average between the intake fractions model and the Local study-FASST
approach.

### Road transport co-benefits

In the current version of CPAT, total fatalities from road accidents in
2020 are projected based on 2011-2016 data from World Road Statistics.
It is recommended that the user checks the validity of this estimate
using local data sources, if available, noting that the underlying
assumptions can vary significantly from one data source to another. The
user might also want to cross-check “forecasted” total distance driven
in 2020 (e.g., around 200 billion vehicle-km for Poland as shown in the
left-hand side figure) against national statistics, if available.

|                                                                                  |                                                                                          |

### Currency used in CPAT

CPAT is presented in constant US dollars (USD). Monetary variables are
presented in CPAT are in USD real terms. CPAT distinguishes between the
base year – the first year of model calculations (at the time of
writing, 2019) – and the year of real terms constant dollars used (at
the time of writing, 2021). These settings are defined in the dashboard
around cell G60.

CPAT converts between local currencies and US dollars at year of real
terms constant dollars (i.e. 2021) exchange rates, and then uses
(projected or historical) US inflation indices to deflate in time. For
more information on macroeconomic data sources, please see *Appendix A*.

### Energy Units in CPAT

CPAT uses commonly used units where possible, rather than adopting a
fully consistent (SI) approach:

  - For primary and final energy consumption, we use thousand tons of
    oil equivalent (ktoe) per year.
  - For power consumption and generation, we use GWh per year (or TWh
    per year in some graphs).

For prices we use different units depending on the fuel type:

  - For coal, natural gas and biomass, we use $/GJ;
  - For gasoline, diesel, kerosene and LPG, we use $/liter;
  - For crude oil and other oil products we use $/bbl (dollars per
    barrel); and
  - For electricity we use $/kWh.

## In-depth use of CPAT

### Using CPAT

#### Running CPAT

CPAT is a large Excel file of about 20Mb in compressed Excel binary
(.xlsb) format. Its computational needs are substantial, and you should
normally not expect to have other memory-intensive programs open. After
changing a policy or other input it should take a few seconds to update
(you will need to have calculations turned on). You can tell CPAT is
working by the ‘graphs updating’. For example, when you change the
country and the carbon price input (e.g. by changing cell I6 of the
dashboard), the emissions trajectory (around row 44 of the dashboard)
will adjust.

CPAT requires a modern version of Excel (2016 at least) and is tested on
PC, rather than the Apple Macintosh version of Excel. You should use the
desktop, rather than the web version of Excel.

#### Navigating CPAT

You can navigate around CPAT by clicking different tabs. There are three
overarching tabs: Cover (this section), Dashboard (the main tab, next
section), and User Inputs (following subsection). For the rest of this
chapter, we then cover the mitigation module in more detail. After the
four main modules of CPAT (mitigation, distribution, air pollution and
transport), code readable inputs and outputs of CPAT are presented in
MTinput and MToutput tabs (outlined later in this subsection), followed
by various data sources driving CPAT, ordered by tab. To get from a
graph to the underlying data set driving it, please click on the graph
title cell (just above the graph itself) and then use the keyboard to
type *Ctrl-$* on a PC. This will zoom across to the relevant results
area and select the cell containing the title. Have a look around
(usually below the selected cell) to find the respective data.

![Figure 2: CPAT Tabs](./01/media/image19.png)

Figure 1‑15: CPAT Tabs

The subsections can be ‘grouped’ so only one line of results is shown,
or ‘ungrouped’ so that all calculations are shown. To group, click the
small ‘1’ at the top left of the main window. To ungroup one subsection,
click the small + sign on the left-hand side. To ungroup all (not
usually needed), click the small ‘2’ in the same place as the ‘1’.

![Figure 3: Grouping and Ungrouping CPAT
sections](./01/media/image20.png)

Figure 1‑16: Grouping and Ungrouping CPAT sections

#### CPAT visual conventions

CPAT adopts various visual conventions to make the model easier to
follow and code. User inputs are colored yellow. Calculations are white.
CPAT codes are typically in blue. Tan cells (both lighter and darker
shades) represent formulae that are different from those around them and
so cannot be dragged or dragged-onto. The cover tab describes these
visual conventions.

![Figure 4: CPAT Cover Page](./01/media/image21.png)

Figure 1‑17: CPAT Cover Page

### The CPAT dashboard tab

CPAT is controlled by its dashboard which provides the main policy,
modelling and parameter inputs, and the main outputs from the policy or
policies chosen. The dashboard allows the user to input choices
regarding the policy under investigation (such as a carbon tax
trajectory, with different options for exemptions and recycling of the
revenues, or fossil fuel subsidy reform). The dashboard also has options
to allow the user to make different modeling choices (e.g., alternative
data sources). The tool produces a series of graphs of the impact of the
policy scenarios on several variables, including:

  - Policy inputs and headline overall effects;
  - Mitigation and energy use (i.e., the reduction in Greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions, changes in energy consumption); macroeconomic and
    fiscal aggregates (GDP, tax revenues);
  - Distributional impacts (per income decile, but also urban/rural, and
    industrial outputs);
  - Air pollution and health (concentration, but also mortality and
    morbidity); and
  - Transport (road fatalities and congestion).

![Figure 5: Dashboard: Illustration of the CPAT 1.0 Dashboard (partial
view, see the excel file for the full
dashboard)](./01/media/image22.png)

Figure 1‑18 Illustration of the CPAT 1.0 Dashboard (partial view, see
the excel file for the full dashboard)

In the dashboard, the policy scenario and the baseline are sometimes
shown on the same graph, with the baseline shown with a dashed line.

Many CPAT settings have default values. These are usually denoted by an
asterix suffix – e.g. “Yes\*“.

#### Policy input area: Country and proposed policy trajectory

At the top left of CPAT, you see various input cells. The yellow cells
are user editable. Categorical cells can be altered by clicking the
small down arrow. By clicking on the cell which currently shows carbon
tax, you can select a different carbon pricing policy (e.g., an ETS),
which comes with sectoral exemptions pre-set. All policies are defined
by the carbon price. The carbon price trajectory is defined by the
introduction date (here 2022), the start level (here $50/tCO2), the
target level of the carbon price (here $75/tCO2), and the year that this
target level will be met (here 2030).

On the right-hand side at the top of the dashboard, the user can change
settings relating to the phase-out of exemptions, price controls, and
subsidies. One can exempt any fuels and sectors from the carbon tax (if
unticked). So, if, for example, Kerosene and Cement are unticked, all
Kerosene is exempted (independent of the sector), and all Cement energy
use is exempted (independent of fuel). It is necessary to ensure that
all checkboxes are ticked for full policy coverage (recommended) or
unticked as desired. It also includes supplementing policies with
renewable energy subsidies and the use of revenues. For revenue
recycling, there are five options: labor tax reductions, corporate tax
reductions, public investment, current spending, and compensatory
transfers to households. The phase-out of exemptions, price controls,
and subsidies, as well as the use of revenue, should be as desired by
the user.

![Figure 6: Dashboard: Phase-out policies](./01/media/image23.png)

Figure 1‑19: Phase-out policies

#### Policy inputs panel

The first panel shows the result of the policy inputs. This includes
**Carbon Price Trajectory**: To check that the suggested carbon tax is
in place, please see the policy strength graph under Key inputs and
outputs. On default settings, the policy is extended linearly beyond the
end date. The dotted lines in the left-hand graph show the range for a
carbon price recommended by the High-level Commission on Carbon Pricing.
The right-hand graph shows the policy’s coverage, including any
exemptions (see later for defining exemptions).

![Figure 7: Dashboard: Policy design](./01/media/image24.png)

Figure 1‑20: Policy design

There are further graphs in this panel, indicating the use of policy
coverage, use of revenue, baseline GDP and energy price assumptions,
income and price elasticity assumptions.

The description of both the advanced settings and the settings of the
power models are presented in *Appendix F - Parameter options in the
mitigation module*.

#### Overview of policies accounted for in CPAT

CPAT covers carbon pricing, taxes, feebates[^1_2], efficiency policies,
fossil fuel subsidy reform, and power-sector-specific policies (e.g.,
Power Pricing Agreement reform). The main carbon pricing and fossil fuel
subsidy reform policies are selected in the main dashboard.

![Figure 25: CPAT: Main Policy Dashboard](./01/media/image25.png)

Figure 1‑21: Main Policy Dashboard

#### Economy-wide carbon pricing options in CPAT

CPAT accounts for an extensive list of carbon pricing instruments. These
can be selected in the ‘Policy’ box shown below.

![Figure 26: Select Policy](./01/media/image26.png)

Figure 1‑22: Select Policy, CPAT Dashboard

##### Carbon taxation

This policy represents a carbon tax applied to the supply of all fossil
fuels in proportion to their carbon content. It is modeled by adding to
the pre-existing tax on a particular fuel a charge equal to the product
of the CO2 emissions factor for that fuel and the tax rate on CO2. The
carbon tax can be comprehensive in applying to all fuels and sectors, or
exemptions can be applied for individual fuels and sectors (with the
option to phase out exemptions over time).

To the extent they are passed on, carbon taxes are reflected in higher
prices for electricity. The increase in electricity prices has two
components: (i) the pure abatement costs which reflect increase in
generation costs per unit due to the shifting to cleaner, but costlier,
generation fuels; and (ii) the tax on remaining emissions per unit of
production (or carbon charges on fossil fuel inputs per unit of
production). The second part can be rebated either by a dedicated policy
(see power feebate below) or by a modification of a comprehensive carbon
tax.

For carbon taxation and for the other comprehensive carbon pricing
schemes, the user can define sectoral or fuel exemptions using the check
boxes in the main dashboard.

##### Emission Trading Systems 

These policies are modeled in a similar way to a tax (CPAT is
deterministic and does not capture uncertainty over emissions prices
associated with ETSs). That is, CPAT requires the user to estimate the
likely price of an ETS and then impose that to find the emissions
reduction. That said, there is also a ‘goal seek’ functionality which
allows one to change the price in order to meet a particular emissions
target in 2030. Because CPAT is set up without macros, the actual goal
seek needs to be done by hand set up by the user using in-built Excel
goal seek or seeker routine.

A scalar adjustment, set at a default value of 0.9, is applied to the
emissions price, which however implies a (moderately smaller) behavioral
response from the ETS compared with the equivalent carbon tax with the
same price. This scalar could represent: (i) exclusion of small emitting
firms from an ETS applied downstream to large firms in the power and
industry sectors; (ii) higher price uncertainty under an ETS compared
with a tax which potentially dampens investment incentives for
low-carbon technologies; and (iii) grandfathering of allowances to
incumbent firms creating barriers to new entrants and potentially
forestalling innovation.

![Figure 27: CPAT: Goal Seek to Determine (ETS or Carbon Tax) Carbon
Price consistent with emissions target](./01/media/image27.png)

Figure 1‑23: Goal Seek to Determine (ETS or Carbon Tax) Carbon Price
consistent with emissions target

In the dashboard, a goal seek tool is available in order to determine
the carbon price matching the emissions target. The goal seek is set
around cell Y192 of the dashboard near the panel D of the mitigation
section. To use it:

  - Connect cell I6 (Target level of carbon price) to be equal to call
    AC192 (so that the carbon tax is in the same location as the
    emissions);

  - Define the coverage of the emissions target using the boxes from
    cell AC194 downwards;

  - Define the coverage percentage of industry in the target;

  - Define the percentage reduction or absolute emissions target; and

  - Modify cell AC192 until cells AB214 and AD214 are as close as
    possible or set up a goal seek to minimize cell AE214 by changing
    the target carbon price (cell I6).

![Figure 28: CPAT: Goal Seek to Determine (ETS or Carbon Tax) Carbon
Price consistent with emissions target](./01/media/image28.png)

Figure 1‑24: Goal Seek to Determine (ETS or Carbon Tax) Carbon Price
consistent with emissions target

The goal seek only works for 2030 emissions and can be used for NDC or
for ETS targeting.

Note that CPAT models *new* ETSs and Carbon Taxes separately from
*existing* ETSs and Carbon Tax. For the European Union countries for
example, the existing ETS price are projected forward: the growth rate
in this projection can be set in the dashboard. It should also be noted
that new ETSs are modeled as a sector being ‘in’ or ‘out’, whereas
existing ETSs use an aggregated percentage of industry and power based
on aggregated coverage data. When a sector is partly included, the
carbon price is proportionally reduced by the coverage proportion and
the reduced carbon price is applied to the whole sector.

##### Feebates

In their pure form, feebates provide a revenue-neutral, sliding scale of
fees on activities (like power generation) or products (like vehicles).
Activities or products with above average emission rates pay a net tax;
activities or products with below average emission rates get net
revenues. When a feebate is constructed by a carbon tax plus a rebate
based on output (e.g., kWh electricity produced, steel produced, etc.)
this is called Output Based Rebating (OBR). But there are other feebates
differing from this form, for example when the feebate is on the initial
purchase decision, rather the ongoing use (e.g., in the case of
vehicles).

In most cases, feebates are modeled through shadow prices. Shadow prices
are modeled not by a change in prices per se but rather a price-like
adjustments to energy use equations. These shadow prices affect the
efficiency channel of the energy use (typically about half the overall
price-based effect) but not the usage channel.

Power supply feebates are modeled as a rebated carbon tax (i.e. a carbon
tax that only increases power prices through pure abatement costs, not
the cost of emissions).

#### Sectoral carbon pricing and taxation policies

***Coal excise tax*.** The coal excise tax is a carbon tax (in the sense
of it being defined per ton CO2) only on coal.

***Electricity emission tax*.** This imposes a carbon tax on the
electricity sector.

***Electricity excise*.** This is a tax per kWh of electricity used. We
set the tax via the standard carbon tax interface. The tax in $/tCO2 is
mapped to one per kWh using the year one emission factor as a conversion
factor. However, this is only a tax on end users of electricity, it does
not distinguish between different ways of generating electricity,
incentivizing only electricity demand and not the composition of
electricity supply.

***Power feebate*.** This policy covers power supply feebates if the
engineer model is selected and covers power usage feebates if the
elasticity model is selected.

***Vehicle fuel economy*.** This imposes shadow prices (similar to a
feebate) in the vehicle sector.

***Road fuel tax*.** Taxes imposed on all fuels in the road transport
sector.

***Sectoral fossil fuel excise taxes*.** These can be modeled by the
user, using this setting in the dashboard. This allows the user to set
sector- and fuel-specific carbon taxes.[^1_3]

![Figure 29: Excise Reform Settings](./01/media/image29.png)

Figure 1‑25: Excise Reform Settings

The actual sectoral-fuel tax rates are set in the ‘Manual Inputs’ tab.

![Figure 30: Excise Reform Settings](./01/media/image30.png)

Figure 1‑26: Excise Reform Settings

#### Regulations and subsidies

*Energy efficiency regulations*. CPAT can model CO2 emission rate
standards per kWh of power generation, per unit of production for
individual industries, or per vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) for
vehicles, or energy efficiency standards for electricity demand, and
energy use in the industry, transport, and building sectors. These
policies reduce the emissions or energy intensity of a sector but
without the same demand response (e.g., reductions in VKT) as under
carbon pricing because they do not involve the pass through of carbon
tax revenues (or allowance rents) in higher prices (e.g., for
electricity or gasoline) – they also produce a partially offsetting
increase in emissions through the rebound effect. In particular, CPAT
focuses on residential and industrial efficiency regulations.

*Clean technology subsidies*. Subsidies for renewable generation are
modeled in CPAT by a subsidy providing a proportionate reduction in the
per unit generation cost for renewables. Subsidies for electric vehicles
(EV) are not explicitly modeled in CPAT.

#### Fossil fuel subsidy reform and regulated price reform

CPAT includes extensive capabilities to reform fossil fuel subsidies.
For each form of subsidy (i.e., producer-side and consumer-side) one can
select the phase out check box and then the number of years to phase out
that subsidy. CPAT also includes some estimations of price controls,
which can also be phased out (although there are interaction effects so
doing both at the same time is not advised). We recommend the default
assumptions for fossil fuel subsidies to be checked and/or replaced by
the user (user defined subsidies are defined in the manual inputs tab
and the dashboard or mitigation tab – the dom\_prices tab contains the
default assumptions on prices and subsidies). For more information, see
the Section *Fuel prices, taxes and subsidies* and Sub-Section *Fiscal
revenues* of this chapter. Note that whether fossil fuel subsidy reform
is included in the baseline is in the advanced settings. The user should
check the following setting:

![Figure 31: Excise Reform Settings](./01/media/image31.png)

Figure 1‑27: Excise Reform Settings

#### Power sector-specific policies

CPAT has the capability to adjust the maximum rate of renewable scale
up. This is set for default to 2% for wind and 2% for solar, meaning
that we could add (gross of retirements) additional generation equal to
2% of the total for each generation type. For many countries, this
growth rate is too ambitious, and a tighter cap will be needed. On the
other hand, more ambitious renewables policies could lead to this cap
being loosened. This constraint is the same in the baseline and the
policy scenario.

CPAT includes the ability to set the proportion of fossil-fueled
generation that is covered by PPAs and to model the reform of those PPAs
by subjecting them to market costs (including carbon pricing).

CPAT can choose which generation types are investible or not. The user
has four options: ‘yes’ (i.e. invests according to cost), ‘no’
(i.e. does not invest in this technology type), ‘if present’
(i.e. invests if this option is present) and ‘manual’ (i.e. capacity
additions are set in manual inputs).

Thus, CPAT allows one to phase out any power generation type (preventing
any new investment being made). CPAT also by default allows retirement
of coal power driven by carbon pricing and allows the user to set the
proportion of coal power subject to such retirement (by default 80%).

CPAT also has the capacity to adjust the financial characteristics of
the power sector (cost of capital, etc.). These settings, both for the
baseline and the policy scenario, are set in the power settings part of
the dashboard. The user can also set the default costs of capital for
each income-level. Those settings are in the ‘Power’ tab.

CPAT by default has a power sector storage requirement which imposes the
marginal system cost of needed storage on new variable renewable energy
investment. The storage includes short- and long-term components. The
latter component is highly uncertain, and the user is encouraged to
check and confirm these settings.

![Figure 32: Power Sector Specific Policies](./01/media/image32.png)

Figure 1‑28: Power Sector Specific Policies

#### Other policies

Other policies are not included in CPAT at this point. These include
public investments (e.g., in smart grids or public transportation), low
carbon fuel standards, biofuel mandates, building codes, incentives for
specific technologies (e.g., geothermal power, nuclear, carbon capture
and storage), emission rate policies for non-road vehicles, measures for
extractive industries (e.g., moratoria on extraction, charges on
production or fugitive emissions), and mitigation instruments beyond the
energy sector. Broader policies to promote R\&D into critical
technologies are also beyond the scope of CPAT.

#### Metrics for comparing policies

The CPAT Dashboard provides a series of results that can be used to
compare policies across different dimensions. The main metrics are
described below.

***CO2 emissions*.** CO2 emissions are given by the consumption of each
fossil fuel product, aggregated across sectors, multiplied by the CO2
emissions factor for that fuel product, and then aggregated across
different fossil fuel products.

***Revenue*.** Revenues from carbon mitigation policies are calculated
net of indirect changes in revenues (or outlays) from pre-existing
energy taxes (or subsidies). Direct revenues from carbon pricing are
simply the carbon price times the CO2 emissions to which they are
applied and, in the case of ETSs, the fraction of allowances that are
auctioned (rather than freely allocated). Revenues from pre-existing
energy taxes are the product of the prior fuel tax rate (which is
negative in the case of fuel subsidies) and the fuel consumption to
which they are applied, aggregated across fuels and sectors, plus the
product of any electricity tax and the electricity consumption to which
it applies. Indirect revenue losses from carbon pricing are the
difference between revenues from pre-existing energy taxes before and
after carbon pricing. Similarly, revenues from new, or increases in
existing, energy taxes are the tax increase times the fuel or
electricity to which the increase applies, net of indirect revenue
changes from pre-existing energy taxes.

For regulations and revenue-neutral feebates there is no direct revenue,
though there is generally an indirect revenue loss as these policies
erode bases for pre-existing energy taxes. For renewable and clean
technology subsidies, there is a direct revenue loss equal to the
product of the subsidy rate and the base to which it applies plus
indirect revenue losses from pre-existing energy taxes.

***Externalities**.* CPAT estimates externalities due to improved human
health (because of reduction in air pollution), reduced road accidents,
reduced travel time and reduced road maintenance costs. Please refer to
the *Air Pollution* and *Transport* chapters for more information on the
externalities calculation.

***Distributional* effects**. CPAT also offers an incidence analysis
about the consumption effects that household could experience after a
carbon pricing policy. The details can be consulted in the
*Distribution* chapter.

***GDP Effects.*** GDP growth will be affected by carbon pricing and the
total impact will depend on how the revenues are used and other
assumptions and parameters used in CPAT. Please refer to the *Output*
section for details.

***Climate benefits.*** The climate benefits are linked to the GHG
emission reductions that can be achieved with a policy and the social
cost of carbon. For details on emissions calculations and the social
cost of carbon in CPAT, please refer to Chapter 3 on the Mitigation
Methodology.

Using the previous metrics, the Section ***Monetized welfare benefits***
discusses the estimation of the monetized domestic environmental costs
from fuel use. The domestic environmental co-benefits of mitigation
policies are calculated by the induced reductions in use of a fuel
product in a particular sector, multiplied by the corresponding domestic
environmental cost per unit, and aggregated across sectors and fuels.
Efficiency costs of policies reflect losses in producer and consumer
surplus in fossil fuel markets, which in turn correspond to areas under
marginal abatement cost schedules – they can be interpreted as the
annualized costs of using cleaner, but costlier technologies, and of
reducing energy consumption below levels households would otherwise
prefer. Efficiency costs are calculated using applications and
extensions of long-established formulas in the public finance literature
(e.g., Harberger, 1964) based on second-order approximations. These
formulas can be applied with data on the size of tax distortions in fuel
and electricity markets, any induced quantity changes in markets
affected by these distortions (an output from the model), and any new
source of price distortion created by carbon policies.

Figure 1‑29: Monetized Welfare Benefits in CPAT Dashboard

#### Headline projected effects panel

The main outputs are shown under Headline projected effects, in Panel B
in CPAT Dashboard. Starting from the left, these graphs show:

1.  GHG emissions relative to baseline (dashed line) & NDC target
    (dotted horizontal line);
2.  Fiscal revenues (before recycling of funds);
3.  Impact on projected GDP growth;
4.  Impacts on households (note: only countries for which household data
    are available);
5.  Co-benefits: Averted air pollution & road accident deaths; and
6.  Total monetized benefits from the policy.

![Figure 8: Dashboard: Main outputs](./01/media/image34.png)

*Figure* *1‑*30*: Headline projected effects, Dashboard tab*

#### Advanced settings

Advanced settings can be defined throughout the Dashboard, related to
the different CPAT modules. The settings are displayed by clicking the +
button to expand.

For instance, for the Mitigation module, the first panel of advanced
settings is around row 16 and includes key policy options, sources for
key inputs, uncertainty adjustments and miscellaneous effects.

![Figure 9: Dashboard: General settings](./01/media/image35.png)

*Figure* *1‑*31*: General settings*

The mitigation module also has wide range of advanced options which are
covered around row 58. For example, the user has an option to specify
existing ETS permit price growth for future years, can choose to apply
the same VAT tax rate in the residential and transport sectors if it is
different from the general VAT in the economy, adjust social cost of
carbon tax and more.

![Figure 10: Dashboard: Advanced Mitigation
Options](./01/media/image36.png)

Figure 1‑32: Advanced Mitigation Options

The dashboard includes advanced parameter options for the power models
around row 109. This includes, for example, information on the
proportion of fossil-fueled generation that is covered by power purchase
agreements (PPAs), an important measure of how inflexible the power
sector is to prices due to market structure factors. To access this
panel, click the plus sign to ungroup.

![Figure 11: Dashboard: Power model settings](./01/media/image32.png)

*Figure* *1‑*33*: Power model settings*

#### Mitigation module: Advanced settings and detailed results

The mitigation module panels show the following results:

1.  Energy baseline externalities, prices, consumption, and targets;
2.  Power sector results;
3.  Fiscal, macroeconomic, and welfare effects;
4.  GHG emissions and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs); and
5.  Energy-related CO2 emissions by fuel & sector (power, industries and
    transport).

The baseline externalities, prices, consumption and targets panel
contain information about estimated externalities, energy price changes
induced by the policy, and projected and efficient price change. One can
select the ‘year of interest’ in the top right of the panel. The lower
row shows sectoral and fuel energy consumption changes (the baseline is
with the dotted line), changes induced by the policy and national
sectoral NDC targets.

![Figure 12: Dashboard: Prices Panel](./01/media/image37.png)

*Figure* *1‑*34*: Prices Panel*

The CPAT power panel contains information about the electricity system.
The graphs are shown below. One can select the ‘year of interest’ in the
top right of the panel. CPAT has two power models: the elasticity-based
and technoeconomic (engineer) models, with the default set to the
average between the two. However, the more CPAT can be tailored by the
user to country-specific settings, the more the user is encouraged to
use the ‘engineer’ choice (this is selectable on cell L24 in the
original ‘more detailed options’ panel).

![Figure 13: Dashboard: Power model settings](./01/media/image38.png)

*Figure* *1‑*35*: Power model settings*

The fiscal effects contain notably the multipliers used in CPAT (bottom
left) - the default is MFmod multipliers. The bottom middle shows the
net GDP effects in time.

![Figure 14: Mitigation Dashboard: Fiscal, macroeconomic and welfare
effects](./01/media/image39.png)

*Figure* *1‑*36*: Fiscal, macroeconomic and welfare effects*

The emissions panel shows a deep dive into GHG emissions.

![Figure 15: Mitigation: GHG and short-lived climate pollutants
panel](./01/media/image40.png)

*Figure* *1‑*37*: GHG and short-lived climate pollutants panel*

The energy related emissions show a deep dive into CO2 and other
energy-related emissions including the Kaya identity which disaggregates
the drivers of emissions changes.

![Figure 16: Mitigation Dashboard: Energy-related
emissions](./01/media/image41.png)

*Figure* *1‑*38*: Energy-related emissions*

#### Distributional consumption effects on households

For distributional results, first, check if household data for your
country is already included; if yes, define how to transfer revenues
(dropdown in ‘Policy options’); adjust accordingly if red flags appear.
If ‘No’ adjustment for behavioral/structural change is selected, the
price increases are fully passed on to the consumer which may
overestimate consumption effects (i.e. tax-induced mitigation effect is
not considered). Alternatively, choose to factor in decile-specific
price-driven demand adjustments/elasticities.

Choose representation of means or medians: while median effects are more
representative, some fuels may not be shown if \>50% of households
report zero or missing expenses (e.g., if poor data quality). Make an
informed choice on mean/median representation and modelling results
with/out taking into account reduced prices due to behavior adjustments.

![Figure 17: Dashboard: Distributional settings](./01/media/image42.png)

*Figure* *1‑*39*: Distributional settings*

For more information, please see the distribution chapter of CPAT
documentation.

#### Air pollution (and associated health effects) results

The recommended default option to estimate concentration changes is
“*Avg. iF and LS FASST\**” or “*Local study-FASST*”. See the air
pollution methodology chapter for more details on what the different
options entail. Is important to check the sectors’ contribution to
ambient PM2.5 and adjust modeling approach if needed.

As in the other sections of CPAT, the cells in yellow can be modified by
the user. For instance, the user can input a local Value of the
Statistical Life to value air pollution externalities from fossil fuels.

![](./01/media/image43.png)

*Figure* *1‑*40*: Air Pollution settings in CPAT Dashboard*

Some additional parameters can be modified in the “Manual inputs” tab. A
link to this tab is at the end of the air pollution settings in the
Dashboard. In that tab, the user can input source apportionment
information, that reflects the sectoral contribution to ambient PM2.5 in
the analyzed country. Notice that for CPAT to use that manual input, the
“Emissions to concentrations, PM2.5” parameter needs to be set to
“Manual-FASST”.

For more information, please see the air pollution chapter from CPAT
documentation.

#### Transport co-benefits (road accidents, congestion, and road damage)

The group of panels shows the results for transport co-benefits. This
includes results for distance traveled, fatalities on the road,
congestion, fuel prices and the statistical relationship between fuel
prices, accidents and congestion.

For more information, please see the transport chapter of this
documentation.

### Manual inputs tab: Tailoring CPAT

CPAT is designed to be able to be run ‘off the shelf’. Nevertheless, the
default settings will usually need to be checked and tested for the
country context. In particular:

  - The prices and subsidy information should be checked and, if needed,
    augmented on the manual settings tab.
  - The user can set the investment trajectory in the power sector, both
    in the baseline and the policy scenarios. For more information,
    please see the CPAT quick-start guide.

Most of these tailored inputs are stored in the manual inputs tab. This
tab also gives the option to add any combination of additional fuel- and
sector-specific taxes (excise reform section).

![Figure 19: Dashboard: Manual Inputs tab](./01/media/image44.png)

*Figure* *1‑*41*: Manual Inputs tab*

### Navigating other CPAT tabs

Each module is divided into sections (dark green) and subsections (light
green). As mentioned earlier, subsections can be ‘grouped’ so only one
line of results are shown, or ‘ungrouped’ so that all calculations are
shown. To group, click the small ‘1’ at the top left of the main window.
To ungroup one subsection, click the small + sign on the left-hand side.
Note that in CPAT, codes have the following format:

*Country.Tab.Variable.Sector.FuelType.Other.SubscenarioNumber*[^1_4]

Users may wish occasionally to change the coding of CPAT itself. In this
case it is noted that CPAT is designed in such a way that the whole of
part C (the baseline scenario) can be copy-pasted into part D (the
policy scenario) or vice versa. It however important not to copy the
first, dark green row of part C (D) which designates the baseline (the
policy implemented). Note also that due to computational limitations,
for the Mitigation module, part C should be copy-pasted into part D,
subsection by subsection, rather than all at one time. More information
on coding or modifying CPAT is available on request.

To ensure CPAT is copy-pastable, three principles must be covered:

  - There should be **no references between C and D**
  - References to other sections than C and D or to other tabs **must be
    row-absolute** (e.g. ‘*MTInputs\!$F$212’*)
  - References within a submodule (C) to other parts of C **must be
    row-relative** (without a $ before the row number – e.g.
    ‘*MTInputs\!F$212*’)
  - References in the results are referring to C and D **must use an
    ‘Index-match’** based on the CPAT code. This means that the user
    should:
    1.  Define a helper row (or column if needed) number, using the
        MATCH function in Excel based on the CPAT code.
    2.  Use the INDEX function in Excel.

#### The Mitigation tab

The following figure shows the organization of the mitigation module.

![Figure 34: Mitigation module: Overview](./01/media/image45.png)

Figure 1‑42: Mitigation module: Overview

The mitigation module is divided into several sub-sections:

  - **Part A: Overview**.

![Figure 35: Mitigation module: Overview](./01/media/image46.png)

Figure 1‑43: Mitigation module: Overview

  - **Part B: Key Assumptions and inputs**. This section comprises
    assumptions used and data inputs (i.e. macro data, elasticities,
    energy consumption, domestic and international prices, etc.)
  - **Parts C and D: The main model repeated twice (baseline and policy
    – usually a carbon tax)**. In particular, part C holds for the
    baseline scenario and part D for the policy scenario. These parts
    are identical, except that part D accounts for the policy
    implemented. These sections build the two power models (based on
    prices inputs) and calculates the energy use across the main sectors
    (i.e. industry, building, transport, and other energy use), as well
    as the associated emissions. The sections also provide estimates on
    the fiscal revenues resulting from the policy in place and
    associated GDP effects.
  - **Parts E and F: The results areas**. Finally, parts E and F
    summarize all the results to create the graphic visualization. This
    area cannot be ‘grouped’ as then otherwise parts of graphs that rely
    on these data would not be visible.

#### The Distribution tab

The organization of the Distribution module is shown in Figure 1‑44.

![](./01/media/image47.png)

Figure 1‑44. Distribution module organization

The Distributional effects module is divided into the following
sections:

  - **A: Module overview**:
      - **A.I. Description.** This sub-section provides a brief flow
        chart-style outline of the Distribution module (see Figure
        1‑45):

![](./01/media/image48.png)

Figure 1‑45: Distribution module description

  - **A.II. Country coverage.** This sub-section lists the WB member
    countries, for which analytical outputs are available in the CPAT
    Distribution module.

<!-- end list -->

  - **B: Key Assumptions and inputs**. This section includes: 1) module
    assumptions, e.g., years of reference, macro variables, scaling
    factors for calibration to national accounts data, etc. (sub-section
    B.I); 2) sector- and energy product-specific percent price changes
    from the Mitigation module used in the analysis (sub-sections B.II
    and B.III); and 3) cost/price pass-through coefficients (sub-section
    B.IV.).
  - **C: Climate policy scenario (e.g., Carbon tax).** This section
    includes the distributional effects (consumption incidence) analysis
    and related calculations. Specifically, it is divided into: 1)
    calculations of the definitive energy and non-energy price changes
    used in the analysis (sub-section C.I); 2) various adjustments to
    the incidence effects analysis, based on user inputs (e.g.,
    decile/product-specific price elasticities of demand, behavioral and
    structural change adjustment, etc.) (sub-section C.II); 3) household
    budget shares for fuel (sub-section C.III) and non-fuel (sub-section
    C.IV) consumption; 4) incidence effects from fuel (sub-section C.V),
    non-fuel (sub-section C.VI) and total (sub-section C.VII)
    consumption; 5) calibration of data to national accounts
    (sub-section C.VIII); 6) effects on inequality (sub-section C.IX);
    7) compensation schemes via transfers (sub-section C.X); and 8)
    compensation schemes via personal income tax (PIT) reductions
    (sub-section C.XI).
  - **D: Outputs for charts**. This section extracts results for the
    various charts available in the Dashboard. It comprises of: 1)
    various chart labels (sub-section D.I); 2) vertical (between-decile)
    consumption incidence results expressed in “relative terms”/percent
    of household consumption (sub-section D.II); 3) vertical
    (between-decile) incidence results expressed in “absolute
    terms”/local currency units (LCU) (sub-section D.III); 4)
    horizontal (within-decile) incidence results expressed in “relative
    terms”/percent of household consumption (sub-section D.IV); 5)
    percent of climate policy revenues needed to fully compensate given
    deciles (sub-section D.V); and 6) percent increases in industry/firm
    costs by sector (sub-section D.VI). This area should remain
    ‘ungrouped’ (or otherwise unhidden), to allow for visualization of
    the relevant charts in the Dashboard.

#### The Air pollution tab

The Air pollution module is divided into several sub-sections, as
presented in Figure 1‑46.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><ol type="a">
<li><p>Sections A and B in the Air pollution tab</p></li>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Figure 1‑46. Overview of the Air Pollution tab in CPAT

  - **Part A: Description or Overview**. The first part of the module
    contains an overview of the contents in the tab. This tab receives
    as input energy consumption and emissions from the Mitigation
    module. Using those inputs (among other inputs), this module
    produces ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter and
    ozone, health impacts and economic impacts of pollution.
  - **Part B: Key assumptions and inputs.** This section contains all
    the calibration options available for the air pollution module,
    inputs from the Mitigation module, and other inputs required for
    calculations. In general, in this section are included calculations
    that will feed both the baseline and carbon tax calculations, such
    as the health effects relative risk functions, baseline incidence
    rates, value of the statistical life, among others (see Figure 1‑46
    a).
  - **Part C: Baseline.** This section contains all the calculations for
    the baseline scenario, including ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and
    O3, relative risks, population exposed to pollution, the
    attributable burden of pollution (mortality and morbidity) and
    working days lost due to pollution.
  - **Part D: Carbon price policy.** This section contains all the
    calculations for the policy scenario selected in the Dashboard tab.
    Sections D and C have the exact same calculations. As in the
    Mitigation tab, section C can be copy-pasted into section C.
  - **Part E: Results for other modules.** The Road Transport module in
    CPAT uses some of the calculations made in the Air pollution module,
    such as daily earning from workers, the value of the Statistical
    life and population above 15 years old. Those variables are in this
    section.
  - **Part F: Results for charts.** In this section are located some
    additional calculations regarding the difference between metrics in
    the baseline and in the carbon price scenarios. All the graphs
    included in the Dashboard, related to the Air pollution module, are
    feed by data from this section.
  - **Part G: Equations and notes.** This section includes some of the
    equations used inside the air pollution module. They are numbered
    and when they are used inside the module, they are referenced using
    the equation number.

#### The Transport tab

The Transport tab includes the road transport modelling for CPAT. The
module is divided into several sub-sections, following a similar
structure than the other CPAT modules, as presented in Figure 1‑48.

![](./01/media/image52.png)

Figure 1‑48. Overview of the Transport tab in CPAT

  - **Part A: Description**. The first part of the module contains an
    overview of the contents in the tab. This tab receives as input the
    changes in fuel prices from the Mitigation module. Using those
    inputs (among other inputs), this module produces the number of
    fatalities from road accidents, additional travel time due to
    congestion and road damages.
  - **Part B: Key assumptions and inputs.** This section contains all
    the calibration options available for the Road Transport module,
    country characteristics and elasticities.
  - **Part C: Baseline.** This section contains all the calculations for
    the baseline scenario (accidents, travel time, road damage, among
    others) and fuel prices for the baseline, from the Mitigation tab.
  - **Part D: Carbon price policy.** This section contains all the
    calculations for the policy scenario (accidents, travel time, road
    damage, among others) and fuel prices for the policy scenario, from
    the Mitigation tab. Sections D and C have the exact same
    calculations. As in the Mitigation tab, section C can be copy-pasted
    into section C.
  - **Part E: Results for other modules.** In this section are results
    from the Road Transport module that will be used in other modules.
    For instance, the welfare metrics calculated in the Mitigation
    module are using the transport externalities from this section.
  - **Part F: Results for charts.** In this section are located some
    additional calculations regarding the difference between metrics in
    the baseline and in the carbon price scenarios. All the graphs
    included in the Dashboard related to the Road Transport module using
    the metrics in this section.

#### Data sources tab

CPAT data sources and terms and conditions are shown here in the Data
sources tab.

![Figure 24: CPAT datasources and T\&Cs](./01/media/image53.png)

Figure 1‑49: CPAT data sources and T\&Cs

#### MTInputs tab

This tab contains the assumptions and parameters that are used in the
calculations in CPAT. This means that the configuration observed in the
Dashboard (explained in this document) is not directly used in the
calculations. Rather, the settings from this tab, MTInputs, are used
depending on the CPAT running mode. CPAT can be run in three different
modes:

1.  It can be run ‘from the dashboard’ with user selected settings.
2.  It can be run using fully default settings. To change this, please
    see element 4 in the main policy input area and select ‘Defaults’.
3.  It can be run in multi-country, multi-policy mode. To select this,
    use the ‘Multiscenario Tool’, described in section 1.3.5, which is a
    separate spreadsheet.

![Figure 20: Dashboard: Set Default Settings](./01/media/image54.png)

Figure 1‑50: Set Default Settings

All of these three sets of parameters ‘flow through’ MTinputs tab, which
shows the comprehensive parameter set used for calculation in CPAT.

![Figure 21: MTInputs: Comprehensive Parameter
Inputs](./01/media/image55.png)

Figure 1‑51: MTInputs: Comprehensive Parameter Inputs

#### MTOutputs tab

As it was explained in the previous section, CPAT can be run in a
“multi-country, multi-policy” mode. When this is the case, the tab
MTOutputs stores the results that will be exported to the Multiscenario
Tool, described in the following section. This tab contains a series of
indicators, reflecting the main results from each CPAT module. A view of
this tab is presented in the next figure.

![](./01/media/image56.png)

Figure 1‑52: MTOutputs: Code-readable Output tab

### The Multiscenario Tool (MT)

CPAT run in standalone mode relates to a single country with two
scenarios: the baseline and a policy scenario. CPAT can also be run in
multiscenario mode, meaning for many countries and/or many scenarios.
More information about the multiscenario tool is available on request.

![Figure 23: The Multiscenario Tool](./01/media/image57.png)

Figure 1‑53: The Multiscenario Tool Dashboard

## Country coverage

CPAT currently covers 192 countries. The table below presents the list
of countries and indicates whether the country is covered by CPAT (with
‘Y’ = Yes, indicating the country being covered by CPAT). If the
country is not covered, an explanation is provided to detail what are
the missing information.

[^1_1]:  A ‘goal seek’ functionality is set up in the dashboard (see Section
    1.3.2.4 for more information) and allows the user to change the
    price in order to meet a particular emissions target in 2030.

[^1_2]:  A feebate is a rebated tax which taxes dirty products or activities
    to subsidize greener products or activities such that net revenue is
    zero.

[^1_3]:  To convert a carbon tax to an excise duty, please see emissions
    factors available in the mitigation module.

[^1_4]:  ‘Other’ varies by context – it can mean pollutant in the air
    pollution module or submodel (ie engineer/elastricity) in the power
    module.
